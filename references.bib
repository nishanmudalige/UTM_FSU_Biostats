    abstract = {Mobile phone data have been widely used to model the spread of COVID-19; however, quantifying and comparing their predictive value across different settings is challenging. Their quality is affected by various factors and their relationship with epidemiological indicators varies over time. Here, we adopt a model-free approach based on transfer entropy to quantify the relationship between mobile phone-derived mobility metrics and COVID-19 cases and deaths in more than 200 European subnational regions. Using multiple data sources over a one-year period, we found that past knowledge of mobility does not systematically provide statistically significant information on COVID-19 spread. Our approach allows us to determine the best metric for predicting disease incidence in a particular location, at different spatial scales. Additionally, we identify geographic and demographic factors, such as users’ coverage and commuting patterns, that explain the (non)observed relationship between mobility and epidemic patterns. Our work provides epidemiologists and public health officials with a general—not limited to COVID-19—framework to evaluate the usefulness of human mobility data in responding to epidemics.},

   abstract = {Agent-based simulation modelling has been used in many epidemiological studies on infectious diseases. However, because agent based modelling is a field without any clear protocol for developing simulations the researcher is given a high amount of flexibility. This flexibility has led to many different forms of agent-based epidemiological simulations. In this paper we review the existing literature on agent-based epidemiological simulation models.  From our literature review we identify key similarities and differences in the exisiting simulations. We then use these similarities and differences to create a taxonomy of agent-based epidemiological models and show how the taxonomy can be used.},
