## Interactions Between Compartments


Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. 

$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$
$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = +\beta SI - \gamma I
$$ 
**Defining Parameters**:

**S** : Proportion of population that is susceptible.

**I** : Proportion of population that is infected.

**N** : Total Population


-   Differentials ($\frac {dS}{dt}$ and $\frac {dI}{dt}$): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments

-   $\beta SI$: Total Rate of New Infections in a Population

    -   $\beta$: Transmission Rate

-   $\gamma I$: Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals

    -   $\gamma$: Recovery Rate

Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term:

-   Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment

-   Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment

The signs in each equation indicate the direction of flow between compartments. For instance, $-\beta SI$ represents the loss of susceptible individuals as they become infected, while $+\beta SI$ represents the corresponding gain in the infectious group. The same relationship applies to $\gamma I$, which describes the recovery process in reverse.

Understanding the parameters and signage then, one can understand the equations above. $\frac {dS}{dt}$ calculates the net flow of the susceptible group by subtracting the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by adding the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of the population entering the susceptible compartment). $\frac {dI}{dt}$ calculates the net flow of the infected group by adding the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by subtracting the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of people entering the susceptible compartment). These simple SI equations form the foundation for more complex models, such as SIR or SEIR, which introduce additional compartments to capture recovery, immunity, or incubation dynamics.

```

In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through, it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant.

$$
S+I=N
$$

$$
S+I=1
$$

$$
I=1-S
$$

Building a system of equations:
$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I
$$

Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1: 
$$
\frac {dS} {dt}= -\beta S(1-S) + \gamma (1-S) = (\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)
$$

By taking an integral of both sides, $S(t)$ can be determined:
$$
\int \frac {1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int dt
$$

Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral:
$$
\frac {A}{\gamma - \beta S} + \frac {B}{1-S}= \frac {A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S)}{( \gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}
$$

So then

$$
A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S) = 1
$$ And one can assume: 

$$
A + \beta \gamma = 1
$$

$$
A + B \beta =0
$$

Through partial fractions it will be found that: 
$$
A = \frac {1}{\beta - \gamma }
$$

$$
B = \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}
$$ 
Plugging in the new A and B: 
$$
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int \frac{\beta}{\beta - \gamma}\left(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}\right) + \frac{1}{\gamma - \beta}\left(\frac {1}{1-S}\right)dS
$$ 

Solving the integral on both sides results in: 

$$
\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta} \ln \left| \frac{\gamma - \beta S}{1-S} \right| = t+C
$$

Solving for S(t) finds:

$$
S(t)= \frac {\gamma - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta )t}}{\beta - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta)t}}
$$

Then solving for the constant: 
$$
S(0) = \frac {\gamma - C}{\beta -C}
$$

$$
S_0(\beta - C) = \gamma -C
$$

$$
S_0 \beta - \gamma = C(S_0 -1)
$$

$$
C = \frac{S_0 \beta - \gamma}{S_0 -1}
$$

## Solving the SIR Model

Rough notes on Dynamical Systems (Qualitative Analysis). SIR model as example.

**System of Equations:**

1.  $\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I$

3.  $\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \alpha R$

Note that $S,I,R \in [0,1]$ and $S + I + R = 1$. So $R = 1 - S - I$.

Plugging into the system of equations we get $$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + 2(1 - S - I)
$$

**Equilibria: (new system of equations at equilibria)**

1.  $0 = -\beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $0 = \beta SI - \gamma I \Rightarrow 0 = (\beta S - \gamma) I$

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha R$

From equation 2 we get: $I = 0$, or $S=\frac{\gamma}{\beta}$

Then plugging in $I = 0$ into the system of equations:

1.  $0 = \alpha R$

2.  $0 = -\alpha R$

Solving for $R$ from these 2 equations, we get $R^* = 0$

Since $R = 1 - S - I$, $R^* = 0$, and $I = 0$, then $S^* = 1$ (note: another way to write $S^*$ is $\overline S$). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation.

Therefore, at Equilibrium: $$
(S^*, I^*) = (1, 0)
$$

Also, plugging in $S = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$ into the system of equations:

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$0 = \gamma I - \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) = I (\gamma + \alpha)$

Solving for I we get: $$ 
I^* =  \frac{\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})}{\gamma + \alpha} 
$$

Endemic equilibrium (EE) is: $$
(S^*, I^*) = \left( \frac{\gamma}{\beta}, \frac{\alpha (1- \gamma/\beta)}{\gamma + \alpha} \right)
$$

where $\gamma < \beta$ or $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1$

If $R_0>1$, then the EE exists and is stable while the DFE is unstable. If $R_0<1$, then the EE does not exist (since $S^* = 1/R_0 > 1$, which doesn't make sense) while the DFE is stable.
