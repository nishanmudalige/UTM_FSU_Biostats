**Parameters:**

**S** : Proportion of population that is susceptible.

**I** : Proportion of population that is infected.

**N** : Total Population

**$\beta$** : Transmission rate- the rate at which an infection is transmitted from an infected individual to a susceptible individual.

**$\gamma$** : Recovery rate- the rate at which an individual recovers from an infection and returns to the susceptible class.

In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant.

$$
S+I=N
$$

$$
S+I=1
$$

$$
I=1-S
$$

Building a system of equations: $$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I
$$

Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1: $$
\frac {dS} {dt}= -\beta S(1-S) + \gamma (1-S) = (\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)
$$

By taking an integral of both sides, $S(t)$ can be determined: $$
\int \frac {1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int dt
$$

Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral: $$
\frac {A}{\gamma - \beta S} + \frac {B}{1-S}= \frac {A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S)}{( \gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}
$$

So then

$$
A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S) = 1
$$ And one can assume: $$
A + \beta \gamma = 1
$$

$$
A + B \beta =0
$$

Through partial fractions it will be found that: $$
A = \frac {1}{\beta - \gamma }
$$

$$
B = \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}
$$ Plugging in the new A and B: $$
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}= \int \frac {\beta}{\beta - \gamma}(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}) + \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}(\frac {1}{1-S})
$$ Solving the integral on both sides results in: $$
\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta} ln| \frac{\gamma - \beta S}{1-S} | = t+C
$$

Solving for S(t) finds:

$$
S(t)= \frac {\gamma - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta )t}}{\beta - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta)t}}
$$

Then solving for the constant: $$
S(0) = \frac {\gamma - C}{\beta -C}
$$

$$
S_0(\beta - C) = \gamma -C
$$

$$
S_0 \beta - \gamma = C(S_0 -1)
$$

$$
C = \frac{S_0 \beta - \gamma}{S_0 -1}
$$

Rough notes on Dynamical Systems (Qualitative Analysis). SIR model as example.

**System of Equations:**

1.  $\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I$

3.  $\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \alpha R$

Note that $S,I,R \in [0,1]$ and $S + I + R = 1$. So $R = 1 - S - I$.

Plugging into the system of equations we get $$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + 2(1 - S - I)
$$

**Equilibria: (new system of equations at equilibria)**

1.  $0 = -\beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $0 = \beta SI - \gamma I \Rightarrow 0 = (\beta S - \gamma) I$

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha R$

From equation 2 we get: $I = 0$, or $S=\frac{\gamma}{\beta}$

Then plugging in $I = 0$ into the system of equations:

1.  $0 = \alpha R$

2.  $0 = -\alpha R$

Solving for $R$ from these 2 equations, we get $R^* = 0$

Since $R = 1 - S - I$, $R^* = 0$, and $I = 0$, then $S^* = 1$ (note: another way to write $S^*$ is $\overline S$). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation.

Therefore, at Equilibrium: $$
(S^*, I^*) = (1, 0)
$$

Also, plugging in $S = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$ into the system of equations:

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$0 = \gamma I - \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) = I (\gamma + \alpha)$

Solving for I we get: $$ 
I^* =  \frac{\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})}{\gamma + \alpha} 
$$

Endemic equilibrium (EE) is: $$
(S^*, I^*) = ( \frac{\gamma}{\beta}, \frac{ \alpha (1- \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) } {\gamma + \alpha})
$$

where $\gamma < \beta$ or $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1$

The disease spreads, otherwise it doesnâ€™t. (?)
