# Modelling disease dynamics with ODEs

## **Interactions Between Compartments**

Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of  Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. These equations will be looked at in-depth later in Chapter 3.
$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$
$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = +\beta SI - \gamma I
$$
**Defining Parameters**:

- Differentials ($\frac {dS}{dt} and \frac {dI}{dt}$): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments

- $\beta SI$: Total Rate of New Infections in a Population

  - $\beta$: Transmission Rate
  
- $\gamma I$: Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals

  - $\gamma$: Recovery Rate

Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term:

- Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment

- Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment

In each equation, either $\beta SI$ and $\gamma I$ contain inverse signs, positive and negative. This explicitly defines the relation between the parameters in each context. Looking at $\beta SI$, in the first equation, the sign is negative, indicating that the outflow from the Susceptible compartment as individuals are removed as they become infected and a part of the Infectious compartment; however, in the second equation, the sign is positive, representing the inflow into the Infectious department as individuals become infected and leave the susceptible department. The loss depicted in one equation is gained in the other equation. This relationship is the same for $\gamma I$. The signage is imperative to understand the context in which the flow is occurring. While both equations define the same flow, the interaction at play is defined by the sign of the parameters, illustrating the perspective of each compartment from which the equation is viewed.

**Parameters:**

**S** : Proportion of population that is susceptible.

**I** : Proportion of population that is infected.

**N** : Total Population

**$\beta$** : Transmission rate- the rate at which an infection is transmitted from an infected individual to a susceptible individual.

**$\gamma$** : Recovery rate- the rate at which an individual recovers from an infection and returns to the susceptible class.

In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant.

$$
S+I=N
$$

$$
S+I=1
$$

$$
I=1-S
$$

Building a system of equations: $$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I
$$

Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1: $$
\frac {dS} {dt}= -\beta S(1-S) + \gamma (1-S) = (\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)
$$

By taking an integral of both sides, $S(t)$ can be determined: $$
\int \frac {1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int dt
$$

Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral: $$
\frac {A}{\gamma - \beta S} + \frac {B}{1-S}= \frac {A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S)}{( \gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}
$$

So then

$$
A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S) = 1
$$ And one can assume: $$
A + \beta \gamma = 1
$$

$$
A + B \beta =0
$$

Through partial fractions it will be found that: $$
A = \frac {1}{\beta - \gamma }
$$

$$
B = \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}
$$ Plugging in the new A and B: $$
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}= \int \frac {\beta}{\beta - \gamma}(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}) + \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}(\frac {1}{1-S})
$$ Solving the integral on both sides results in: $$
\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta} ln| \frac{\gamma - \beta S}{1-S} | = t+C
$$

Solving for S(t) finds:

$$
S(t)= \frac {\gamma - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta )t}}{\beta - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta)t}}
$$

Then solving for the constant: $$
S(0) = \frac {\gamma - C}{\beta -C}
$$

$$
S_0(\beta - C) = \gamma -C
$$

$$
S_0 \beta - \gamma = C(S_0 -1)
$$

$$
C = \frac{S_0 \beta - \gamma}{S_0 -1}
$$

Rough notes on Dynamical Systems (Qualitative Analysis). SIR model as example.

**System of Equations:**

1.  $\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I$

3.  $\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \alpha R$

Note that $S,I,R \in [0,1]$ and $S + I + R = 1$. So $R = 1 - S - I$.

Plugging into the system of equations we get $$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + 2(1 - S - I)
$$

**Equilibria: (new system of equations at equilibria)**

1.  $0 = -\beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $0 = \beta SI - \gamma I \Rightarrow 0 = (\beta S - \gamma) I$

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha R$

From equation 2 we get: $I = 0$, or $S=\frac{\gamma}{\beta}$

Then plugging in $I = 0$ into the system of equations:

1.  $0 = \alpha R$

2.  $0 = -\alpha R$

Solving for $R$ from these 2 equations, we get $R^* = 0$

Since $R = 1 - S - I$, $R^* = 0$, and $I = 0$, then $S^* = 1$ (note: another way to write $S^*$ is $\overline S$). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation.

Therefore, at Equilibrium: $$
(S^*, I^*) = (1, 0)
$$

Also, plugging in $S = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$ into the system of equations:

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$0 = \gamma I - \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) = I (\gamma + \alpha)$

Solving for I we get: $$ 
I^* =  \frac{\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})}{\gamma + \alpha} 
$$

Endemic equilibrium (EE) is: $$
(S^*, I^*) = ( \frac{\gamma}{\beta}, \frac{ \alpha (1- \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) } {\gamma + \alpha})
$$

where $\gamma < \beta$ or $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1$

The disease spreads, otherwise it doesnâ€™t. (?)
