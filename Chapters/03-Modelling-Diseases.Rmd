# Modelling disease dynamics with ODEs

## Interactions Between Compartments

Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. 

$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$

Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. These equations will be looked at in-depth later in Chapter 3. 
$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$ 

$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = +\beta SI - \gamma I
$$ 

**Defining Parameters**:


**S** : Proportion of population that is susceptible.

**I** : Proportion of population that is infected.

**N** : Total Population

-   Differentials ($\frac {dS}{dt}$ and $\frac {dI}{dt}$): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments

-   $\beta SI$: Total Rate of New Infections in a Population

    -   $\beta$: Transmission Rate

-   $\gamma I$: Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals

    -   $\gamma$: Recovery Rate

Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term:

-   Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment

-   Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment

The signs in each equation indicate the direction of flow between compartments. For instance, $-\beta SI$ represents the loss of susceptible individuals as they become infected, while $+\beta SI$ represents the corresponding gain in the infectious group. The same relationship applies to $\gamma I$, which describes the recovery process in reverse.

Understanding the parameters and signage then, one can understand the equations above. $\frac {dS}{dt}$ calculates the net flow of the susceptible group by subtracting the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by adding the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of the population entering the susceptible compartment). $\frac {dI}{dt}$ calculates the net flow of the infected group by adding the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by subtracting the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of people entering the susceptible compartment). These simple SI equations form the foundation for more complex models, such as SIR or SEIR, which introduce additional compartments to capture recovery, immunity, or incubation dynamics.

## Solving the SI Model {#sec:SI_model}

```

In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through, it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant.

$$
S+I=N
$$

$$
S+I=1
$$

$$
I=1-S
$$

Building a system of equations:

$$
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac {dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I
$$

Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1 by plugging in (1-S) for I: 
$$
\frac {dS} {dt}= -\beta S(1-S) + \gamma (1-S) = (\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)
$$

By taking an integral of both sides, $S(t)$ can be determined:

$$
\int \frac {1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int dt
$$


Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral: 

$$
\frac {A}{\gamma - \beta S} + \frac {B}{1-S}= \frac {A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S)}{( \gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}
$$

So then:
$$
A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S) = 1

$$
And one can assume: 

$$
A + \beta \gamma = 1
$$

$$
A + B \beta =0
$$

Through partial fractions it will be found that: 
$$
A = \frac {1}{\beta - \gamma }
$$

$$
B = \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}
$$ 

Plugging in the new A and B: 
$$
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int \frac{\beta}{\beta - \gamma}\left(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}\right) + \frac{1}{\gamma - \beta}\left(\frac {1}{1-S}\right)dS
$$ 

Solving the integral on both sides results in: 

$$
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int \frac{\beta}{\beta - \gamma}\left(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}\right) + \frac{1}{\gamma - \beta}\left(\frac {1}{1-S}\right)dS
$$ 


$$
\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta} \ln \left| \frac{\gamma - \beta S}{1-S} \right| = t+C
$$

Solving for S(t) finds:

$$
S(t)= \frac {\gamma - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta )t}}{\beta - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta)t}}
$$

Then solving for the constant: 
$$
S(0) = \frac {\gamma - C}{\beta -C}
$$

$$
S_0(\beta - C) = \gamma -C
$$

$$
S_0 \beta - \gamma = C(S_0 -1)
$$

$$
C = \frac{S_0 \beta - \gamma}{S_0 -1}
$$

## Solving the SIR Model

Building what we have learnt previously from solving the SI model, we will now attempt to solve the SIR model. 

```{r SIRdiagram, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Compartmental Diagrams/SIR.png")
```

The SIR model includes a new compartment, **“R”**, which represents recovery from infection; or alternatively, those removed from infection status.
This removal can occur as a result of immunization from infection, immunity from recovering from the disease, isolation from the population, or death. Note that the latter demographic effects (birth/death) are not observed in our example, and different models can exist for those cases. 


We define a new **system of differential equations** for the SIR model as follows: 

1.  $\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I$

3.  $\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \alpha R$

**Defining the parameters: ** As before, the differentials represent the net flow of individuals in and out of compartments, and $\beta$ represents infection rate (S to I). $\gamma$ represents recovery rate of the infected, but now individuals moving out of compartment “I” (infected) move into compartment “R” (recovered/removed). $\alpha$ is a new term in the equations that represents the re-susceptible rate where recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again (R to S). 


Note that $S,I,R \in [0,1]$. If the population is represented by $N = S + I + R$, we can let $N = 1$ and get $S + I + R = 1$. So $R = 1 - S - I$. 

Plugging into the system of equations we get:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + 2(1 - S - I)
$$

However, unlike the SI model, the SIR model’s system of equations has no closed form solution. Instead, we can find the equilibrium for this system. This system is considered to be a **dynamical system**, and our analysis will be **qualitative**.  

**Equilibrium:** the rate of individuals entering a compartment is equal to the rate of individuals leaving a compartment. 

Thus, we can set each equation in our system of equations to 0. 


**The new system of equations at equilibria:**

1.  $0 = -\beta SI + \alpha R$

2.  $0 = \beta SI - \gamma I \Rightarrow 0 = (\beta S - \gamma) I$

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha R$


There are two types of equilibrium in epidemiology: 

1. **Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE):** there are no infected in the population, so I* = 0 in our SIR model

2. **Endemic Equilibrium (EE):** infected persist indefinitely, so I* > 0 in our SIR model
(notation: asterix indicates equilibrium solution)

**First we solve for DFE.** From equation 2 we get: $I = 0$, or $S=\frac{\gamma}{\beta}$

Then plugging in $I = 0$ into the system of equations:

1.  $0 = \alpha R$

2.  $0 = -\alpha R$

Solving for $R$ from these 2 equations, we get $R^* = 0$

Since $R = 1 - S - I$, $R^* = 0$, and $I = 0$, then $S^* = 1$ (note: another way to write $S^*$ is $\overline S$). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation.

Therefore, at Equilibrium: 

$$
(S^*, I^*) = (1, 0)
$$

Thus, at DFE, the entire population is susceptible to infection and no EE exists because the infectious population returns to zero once the endemic is over. 


**Now, we solve for EE**. Plugging $S = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$ into the system of equations:

3.  $0 = -\gamma I + \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$0 = \gamma I - \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)$

$\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) = I (\gamma + \alpha)$

Solving for I we get: 

$$ 
I^* =  \frac{\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})}{\gamma + \alpha} 
$$

Endemic equilibrium (EE) is: 

$$
(S^*, I^*) = \left( \frac{\gamma}{\beta}, \frac{\alpha (1- \gamma/\beta)}{\gamma + \alpha} \right)
$$

where $\gamma < \beta$. 

EE requires a continuous supply of susceptible ("susceptible replacement"), for instance, by birth, or reduced immunity to the disease. Otherwise, I will approach 0 after the endemic. 

Also, since $\gamma < \beta$, we get $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} > 1$. The **basic reproduction number ($R_0$)** is a threshold quantity that indicates the occurrence of an epidemic. $R_0$ can also be thought of as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals (e.g. at initial time $t = 0$). Note that individual variation is excluded in the definition. 

Specific values of $R_0$ can be used to analyze the stability of equilibrium. This will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 4, but more generally for now: 

- **If $R_0 < 1$**: DFE is stable, the infection dies out (i.e. when infected, an individual infects less than one person on average, then the disease dies out)

- **If $R_0 > 1$**: EE is stable, there is an epidemic (i.e. when infected, an individual infects more than one person on average, then the disease spreads)
