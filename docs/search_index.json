We will learn about compartmental and agent-based models and their extensions that incorporate heterogeneities (age, space, behaviour). We will also explore disease control strategies. Simulation-based demonstrations and coding exercises will help connect theory to real-world insights. Readers should have an understanding of Calculus 1 and 2, ODEs, Intro Stats/Probability, Programming experience, and (maybe) Linear Algebra. 1.2 History of Mathematical Epidemiology For all of human history, diseases have spread through groups of people. An epidemic is a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease at a particular time. An endemic disease on the other hand is one that is always present in certain populations. One of the earliest and deadliest epidemics known is the Black Death, most likely bubonic plague, which started in Asia in 1346 and spread throughout Europe. A later and widely known epidemic is the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19 which caused more than 50 million deaths. Malaria and typhus are examples of endemic diseases. The purpose of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease, predict its course, and develop ways of controlling its spread. The first model in mathematical epidemiology was the work of Daniel Bernoulli on the inoculation of smallpox. Bernoulli calculated the increase in life expectancy if smallpox is removed as a cause of death. The beginnings of compartmental modelling actually started through the work of public health physicians. In 1906, W.H. Hamer proposed that the spread of infection should be observed looking at individuals in compartments: susceptible and infective. Dr. Ross, who worked on malaria, was the first to introduce the concept of the basic reproductive number (R0), which quantifies the number of secondary infections caused by one case in a susceptible population.The framework was then expanded and formalized by Kermack and McKendrick in the late 1920s and early 1930s, laying the foundation for modern epidemic modeling.

In addition, epidemiologists may encounter incomplete and inaccurate data from measurement error, which can hinder parameter estimation and model fitting. (Smeden et al.; Brauer) This is why mathematical modelling in epidemiology plays a major role in our understanding of mechanisms of disease spread. This understanding can suggest strategies for public health and health care responses regarding diseases and epidemics (Brauer; Silal et al.; Tolles &amp; Luong). Models can also identify variables that data may not show. For instance, some models can identify threshold behaviors of epidemics—an indicator of when a disease will become an epidemic, or dies out. This could then be used to determine vaccination plans (Brauer). Compartmental models used today (originating from the Kermack-McKendrick model), can show disease transmission while observing time and infection number in relation to an epidemic (Tolles &amp; Luong). Compartmental models differ with diseases, and their development often relies on various policies. These models must undergo rigorous sensitivity testing to determine ideal parameters that impact model outcomes (Silal et al.). In Chapter 1 of this book, we will be exploring the models that are used in modern epidemiology such as the SIR model. References: Tolles, J., &amp; Luong, T.B. (2020).

Some examples of mathematical models include Population Growth Model: A model that describes how the size of a population changes over time depending on birth rates and death rates. Supply and Demand Model: A model in economics that relates the price of a good to its availability (supply) and how much people want it (demand). It predicts that the price will adjust until the amount supplied equals the amount demanded (market equilibrium). Projectile Motion Model: A physics model for the path of an object thrown into the air. Linear Regression Model: A statistical model that expresses the relationship between a response variable (like exam score) and one or more explanatory variables (like study hours). 2.2 Exponential Growth and Decay Exponential models describe processes that grow or decline at rates proportional to their current size. In the case of exponential growth, the model is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN, \\quad r &gt; 0, \\] which has the solution \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}. \\] When the rate \\(r\\) is negative, we obtain exponential decay, where the quantity decreases over time: \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}, \\quad r &lt; 0. \\] These models are widely used in contexts such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest. Figure 2.1: Exponential growth (left) and exponential decay (right) with initial value \\(N_0=10\\); rates \\(r=0.3\\) and \\(r=-0.3\\). 2.3 Logistic Model The logistic growth model describes how a population grows over time with limited resources. The differential equation form is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right), \\] where - \\(N(t)\\) = population size at time \\(t\\) - \\(r\\) = intrinsic growth rate - \\(K\\) = carrying capacity. The solution to this differential equation is \\[ N(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K - N_0}{N_0}\\right)e^{-rt}}, \\] where \\(N_0\\) is the initial population size at \\(t=0\\). As \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(N(t) \\to K\\), meaning the population stabilizes at the carrying capacity.
