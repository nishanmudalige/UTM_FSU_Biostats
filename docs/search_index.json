We will learn about compartmental and agent-based models and their extensions that incorporate heterogeneities (age, space, behaviour). We will also explore disease control strategies. Simulation-based demonstrations and coding exercises will help connect theory to real-world insights. The following are recommended pre-requisites: introductory calculus, ordinary differential equations, probability and statistics, etc. 1.2 History of Mathematical Epidemiology Throughout human history, diseases have spread through groups of people. An epidemic is a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease at a particular time. An endemic disease, on the other hand, is one that is always present in certain populations. One of the earliest and deadliest epidemics known is the Black Death, also known as the bubonic plague, which started in Asia in 1346 and spread throughout Europe. Another widely known epidemic is the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19 which caused more than 50 million deaths. Malaria and typhus are examples of endemic diseases. Most recently, COVID-19 caused a worldwide lockdown from 2020-2021, infecting 779 million and killing 7 million. The purpose of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease, predict its course, and develop ways of controlling its spread. The first model in mathematical epidemiology was the work of Daniel Bernoulli on the inoculation of smallpox. Bernoulli calculated the increase in life expectancy if smallpox were removed as a cause of death. The beginnings of compartmental modelling started through the work of public health physicians. In 1906, W.H. Hamer proposed that the spread of infection should be observed by looking at individuals in compartments: susceptible and infectious. Dr. Ronald Ross, who worked on malaria, was the first to introduce the concept of the basic reproductive number (R0), which quantifies the number of secondary infections caused by one case in a susceptible population.The framework was then expanded and formalized by Kermack and McKendrick in the late 1920s and early 1930s, laying the foundation for modern epidemic modeling. [1] 1.3 Role of Models in Public Health Due to ethical concerns, it is difficult to design controlled experiments in epidemiology. In addition, epidemiologists may encounter incomplete and inaccurate data from measurement error, which can hinder parameter estimation and model fitting. [2] [3]. This is why mathematical modelling in epidemiology plays a major role in our understanding of mechanisms of disease spread. This understanding can suggest strategies for public health and health care responses regarding diseases and epidemics [4] [3] [5]. Models can also identify variables that data may not show. For instance, some models can identify threshold behaviors of epidemics—an indicator of when a disease will become an epidemic, or dies out [3]. These indicators are based on (R0) in which, if the variable is above, below, or equal to 1, an epedemic may occur, die out or become endemic, respectively. This information could then be used to determine vaccination plans within a population as well as individually [3]. Being able to understand the future spread of disease will give insurmountable advantages in developing a plan of action to combat new infections; additionally, the development of herd immunity can safeguard an entire population through communal protection. Compartmental models used today (originating from the Kermack-McKendrick model), can show disease transmission while observing time and infection number in relation to an epidemic [4]. These models help understand diseases by dividing a population into compartments, such as the SIR model. These models utilize diverse mathematical equations and relationships to understand the flow and movementts between these models, defining these connections help predict the spread of disease regarding an outbreak. Compartmental models differ with diseases, and their development often relies on various policies. These models must undergo rigorous sensitivity testing to determine ideal parameters that impact model outcomes [5]. In Chapter 3 of this book, we will be exploring the models that are used in modern epidemiology, such as the SIR model [4]. "],["introduction-to-mathematical-models-in-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to Mathematical Models in Epidemiology 2.1 Defining Mathematical Models 2.2 Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking", " Chapter 2 Introduction to Mathematical Models in Epidemiology 2.1 Defining Mathematical Models The two major types of mathematical models used in epidemiology are deterministic models and stochastic models. Deterministic models do not consider stochasticity (randomness), and predict results from known data (e.g. epidemic history; rules of models). These models are useful in large populations to observe epidemics in terms of the population and can help determine the fraction of individuals infected in an epidemic, as well as advise on disease control methods [6]. Deterministic models can be written in terms of differential equations in continuous time, or difference equations in discrete time. A common approach for continuous time deterministic models is Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These deterministic compartmental models will be introduced in Chapter 2, while Chapter 3 will discuss solving simple models and their behaviour. Stochastic models account for stochasticity (randomness) and are able to capture variability in demographics and environment. These models are useful with small populations and can be used in determining how long a disease lasts, the probability of an epidemic, and distribution of behaviours [6]. Some types of stochastic models include Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Although stochastic models may better reflect reality, they are more labour-intensive to set-up than deterministic models and can also be more difficult to analyze. References: [3], [6] 2.2 Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking As varying global health concerns persist, it is imperative to understand the complexities within the spread of infectious diseases. The most prevalent of which is compartmental modelling. This is a model that follows the change in proportions of populations in different compartments over time. The most common form of this type of model is the SIR model, organized in three separate compartments: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. Additional forms of this model may incorporate more compartments to attempt to enhance predictability. As computational power and modelling in the field of epidemiology have evolved, the growing use of parsimonious models, such as the SIR model, has become more relevant. These models utilize simpler processes by using accessible key data across broader conditions to produce a sufficiently predictive and generalizable model. [7] [8] 2.2.1 Approach to Compartmental Modelling Referring back, compartmental modelling is the framework for prediction in epidemiology. The fundamental thinking behind the most common compartmental model, the SIR model, is that at any given point, a person will fall into either the Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered compartments, under the model’s assumptions. Susceptible: Those at risk of the disease, but not yet infected Infected: Those currently infected, and can actively spread the disease to those who are Susceptible Recovered/Removed: Individuals who have recovered and developed immunity, or died from the disease Can either be denoted as Recovered or Removed, to account for all outcomes when leaving the “R” compartment. Either individuals are recovered, gaining immunity, and leave or die and leave, counting instead as removed Diving deeper, the relationship between each of these compartments is defined by differential equations, specifically ODEs and dynamical systems. These differential equations depict the movement between S and I, as well as I and R. The differential equations will show the flow of susceptible individuals to the infected compartment as the disease is transmitted at the transmission rate (\\(\\beta\\)) as well as the flow of infected individuals either back to the susceptible compartment or to the recovered compartment at the recovery rate(\\(\\gamma\\)). Other forms of the SIR model exist, in which compartments are added to depict realistic features of disease transmission. Each of these models utilizes an additional compartment that accounts for specific epidemiological situations, described below: SEIR: Exposed - Represents individuals who are infected but not yet infectious Accounts for the latency period, in which individuals may be infected, yet are not able to transmit the disease SAIR: Asymptomatic - Represents individuals who are infected but do not express symptoms Accounts for hidden transmission by individuals without symptoms SIRS: Susceptible - An additional “S” compartment at the end represents those who have recovered but lose immunity and become susceptible again Accounts for the misassumption that those who recover retain lifelong immunity SVIR: Vaccinated - Represents individuals who have received immunity to a varying extent from vaccinations Accounts for how vaccinations reduce the population of susceptible individuals These variations of the SIR model will be discussed at length in Chapter 5 and 6.1. [7] [8] 2.2.2 Benefits of Parsimonious Models As seen, SIR models and other forms can provide great predictive power. Recently, parsimonious models have become of interest in epidemiological modelling. These models are based on the premise that the simplest answer is the best. Allude to earlier in this section where parsimonious models are defined. These are able to use significantly less data and parameters in order to produce a generalized and understandable model. In a real-world setting, these models have been effectively utilized to predict disease outbreaks. Not only are these models more accurate than those with more complexity, but they can also be applied to a multitude of situations; additionally, with the presence of noisy data, these models can also avoid over fitting. [9] 2.2.3 Limitations of Compartmental Models While these models are effective at predicting and understanding the spread of disease, there are issues with both their simplicity and complexity. These models must use a vast amount of assumptions in order to be feasibly produced, which comes at the cost of precision and realism. Some of these assumptions include the interactions between humans, fixed parameters, and assumed immunity. In the real world, these assumptions are not constant or realistic, resulting in a model that may not accurately depict the spread of disease. As a result, additional compartments have been added, such as in SEIR, SAIR, SIRS, and SVIR models discussed earlier. However, the addition of more compartments creates further intricacies. The fundamental models discussed involve three to four compartments; other examples of models may contain a greater number of compartments. While this may improve the precision of the model, as discussed prior, real-world data is noisy. This may lead to over fitting the data, resulting in a lack of generalization and potentially reduced predictive ability.

In this chapter we will define model parameters and the flow between compartments. We will also seek mathematical solutions to the models to gain a comprehensive understanding of model initialization, functionality, and interpretation. The concepts discussed in this chapter provide a foundation for further analysis of epidemiological models explored in later chapters of this book. 3.2 Interactions Between Compartments Figure 3.1: The SI compartmental model. Defining Parameters: S : Proportion of population that is susceptible. I : Proportion of population that is infected. N : Total Population Differentials (\\(\\frac {dS}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac {dI}{dt}\\)): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments \\(\\beta SI\\): Total Rate of New Infections in a Population \\(\\beta\\): Transmission Rate \\(\\gamma I\\): Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals \\(\\gamma\\): Recovery Rate Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term: Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. \\[ \\frac {dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI + \\gamma I \\] \\[ \\frac {dI}{dt} = +\\beta SI - \\gamma I \\] The signs in each equation indicate the direction of flow between compartments. For instance, \\(-\\beta SI\\) represents the loss of susceptible individuals as they become infected, while \\(+\\beta SI\\) represents the corresponding gain in the infectious group. The same relationship applies to \\(\\gamma I\\), which describes the recovery process in reverse. Understanding the parameters and signage then, one can understand the equations above. \\(\\frac {dS}{dt}\\) calculates the net flow of the susceptible group by subtracting the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by adding the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of the population entering the susceptible compartment). \\(\\frac {dI}{dt}\\) calculates the net flow of the infected group by adding the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by subtracting the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of people entering the susceptible compartment). These simple SI equations form the foundation for more complex models, such as SIR or SEIR, which introduce additional compartments to capture recovery, immunity, or incubation dynamics. [11] 3.3 Solving the SI Model In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through, it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant. The goal of solving the SIS model is to understand and predict the spread of an infectious disease within a population. Analyzing differential equations can help predict disease prevalence over time and determine whether a disease is endemic or not. In addition, the differential equations can also be used to identify the size of infected and susceptible populations at the stable endemic state. By solving the differential equations, \\(S(t)\\) and \\(I(t)\\) can be found and used to predict the size of the susceptible and infected compartments at different periods in time. These are the initial assumptions in equation format, showing that within the population, an individual can either be in the susceptible or infected compartment. Together both compartments make up the total population, \\(N\\). \\[ S+I=N \\] It can be assumed that \\(N\\) is equal to 1 and \\(S\\) and \\(I\\) are both proportions of the population. \\[ S+I=1 \\] Rearranging this equation finds: \\[ I=1-S \\] Deriving both of the previous equations creates a system of differential equations: \\[ \\frac {dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI + \\gamma I \\] \\[ \\frac {dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\] Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1 by plugging in \\((1-S)\\) for \\(I\\): \\[ \\frac {dS} {dt}= -\\beta S(1-S) + \\gamma (1-S) = (\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S) \\] After separating the variables, we can take an integral of both sides to determine \\(S(t)\\). \\[ \\int \\frac {1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int dt \\] Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral: \\[ \\frac {A}{\\gamma - \\beta S} + \\frac {B}{1-S}= \\frac {A(1-S)+B( \\gamma - \\beta S)}{( \\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} \\] So then: \\[ A(1-S)+B( \\gamma - \\beta S) = 1 \\] In order to solve this equation, one can assume: \\[ A + \\beta \\gamma = 1 \\] \\[ A + B \\beta =0 \\] Through partial fractions it will be found that: \\[ A = \\frac {1}{\\beta - \\gamma } \\] \\[ B = \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\] Plugging in the new \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\[ \\int \\frac{1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\left(\\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta S}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\gamma - \\beta}\\left(\\frac {1}{1-S}\\right)dS \\] Solving the integral on the left side first results in: \\[ \\int \\frac{1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\left(\\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta S}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\gamma - \\beta}\\left(\\frac {1}{1-S}\\right)dS = \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\ln \\left| \\frac{\\gamma - \\beta S}{1-S} \\right| \\] Solving the integral on the right side results in: \\[ \\int dt = t +C \\] Therefore the new equation is: \\[ \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\ln \\left| \\frac{\\gamma - \\beta S}{1-S} \\right| = t+C \\] Solving for \\(S(t)\\) finds: \\[ S(t)= \\frac {\\gamma - Ce^{(\\gamma - \\beta )t}}{\\beta - Ce^{(\\gamma - \\beta)t}} \\] Then plugging in \\(t=0\\) and using \\(S_0\\) to solve for the constant : \\[ S(0) = \\frac {\\gamma - C}{\\beta -C} \\] \\[ S_0(\\beta - C) = \\gamma -C \\] \\[ S_0 \\beta - \\gamma = C(S_0 -1) \\] \\[ C = \\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1} \\] Plugging \\(C\\) into \\(S(t)\\) results in the final equation for \\(S(t)\\): \\[ S(t)= \\frac {\\gamma - (\\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1}) e^{(\\gamma - \\beta )t}}{\\beta - (\\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1})e^{(\\gamma - \\beta)t}} \\] Thus through this work through of the SIS model, we have found a closed form solution for \\(S(t)\\), which shows the number or proportion of individuals in the susceptible compartment at a time t. Using the function found for \\(S(t)\\), one can plug it into the assumption equations, specifically \\(I+S=1\\), in order to find \\(I(t)\\). In addition, learning from this model, one can note that when \\(\\beta &gt; \\gamma\\), transmission is greater than recovery so there will be a spread of the infections and the disease will be endemic. However, when \\(\\beta &lt; \\gamma\\), recovery occurs faster than transmission and the disease will die out. Solving the SIS model not only provides a solution for \\(S(t)\\) and \\(I(t)\\), but also will provide a groundwork for more complex models, such as the SIR model . 3.4 Solving the SIR Model Building what we have learnt previously from solving the SI model, we will now attempt to solve the SIR model. Figure 3.2: The SIR compartmental model. The SIR model includes a new compartment, “R”, which represents recovery from infection; or alternatively, those removed from infection status. This removal can occur as a result of immunization from infection, immunity from recovering from the disease, isolation from the population, or death. Note that the latter demographic effects (birth/death) are not observed in our example, and different models can exist for those cases. We define a new system of differential equations for the SIR model as follows: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dS}{dt} = - \\beta SI + \\alpha R\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\alpha R\\) Defining the parameters: As before, the differentials represent the net flow of individuals in and out of compartments, and \\(\\beta\\) represents infection rate (S to I). \\(\\gamma\\) represents recovery rate of the infected, but now individuals moving out of compartment “I” (infected) move into compartment “R” (recovered/removed). \\(\\alpha\\) is a new term in the equations that represents the re-susceptible rate where recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again (R to S). Note that \\(S,I,R \\in [0,1]\\). If the population is represented by \\(N = S + I + R\\), we can let \\(N = 1\\) and get \\(S + I + R = 1\\). So \\(R = 1 - S - I\\). Plugging into the system of equations we get: \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = - \\beta SI + 2(1 - S - I) \\] However, unlike the SI model, the SIR model’s system of equations has no closed form solution. Instead, we can find the equilibrium for this system. This system is considered to be a dynamical system, and our analysis will be qualitative. Equilibrium: the rate of individuals entering a compartment is equal to the rate of individuals leaving a compartment. Thus, we can set each equation in our system of equations to 0. The new system of equations at equilibria: \\(0 = -\\beta SI + \\alpha R\\) \\(0 = \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\Rightarrow 0 = (\\beta S - \\gamma) I\\) \\(0 = -\\gamma I + \\alpha R\\) There are two types of equilibrium in epidemiology: Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE): there are no infected in the population, so I* = 0 in our SIR model Endemic Equilibrium (EE): infected persist indefinitely, so I* &gt; 0 in our SIR model (notation: asterix indicates equilibrium solution) First we solve for DFE. From equation 2 we get: \\(I = 0\\), or \\(S=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\) Then plugging in \\(I = 0\\) into the system of equations: \\(0 = \\alpha R\\) \\(0 = -\\alpha R\\) Solving for \\(R\\) from these 2 equations, we get \\(R^* = 0\\) Since \\(R = 1 - S - I\\), \\(R^* = 0\\), and \\(I = 0\\), then \\(S^* = 1\\) (note: another way to write \\(S^*\\) is \\(\\overline S\\)). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation. Therefore, at Equilibrium: \\[ (S^*, I^*) = (1, 0) \\] Thus, at DFE, the entire population is susceptible to infection and no EE exists because the infectious population returns to zero once the endemic is over. Now, we solve for EE. Plugging \\(S = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\) into the system of equations (equation 3): \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 &amp;= -\\gamma I + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} - I \\right) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= \\gamma I - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} - I \\right) \\\\ \\ \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} \\right) &amp;= I (\\gamma + \\alpha) \\end{align*} \\] Solving for I we get: \\[ I^* = \\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\] Endemic equilibrium (EE) is: \\[ (S^*, I^*) = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}, \\frac{\\alpha (1- \\gamma/\\beta)}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\right) \\] where \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta\\). EE requires a continuous supply of susceptible (“susceptible replacement”), for instance, by birth, or reduced immunity to the disease. Otherwise, I will approach 0 after the endemic. Also, since \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta\\), we get \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &gt; 1\\). The basic reproduction number (\\(R_0\\)) is a threshold quantity that indicates the occurrence of an epidemic. \\(R_0\\) can also be thought of as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals (e.g. at initial time \\(t = 0\\)). Note that individual variation is excluded in the definition. Specific values of \\(R_0\\) can be used to analyze the stability of equilibrium. This will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 4, but more generally for now: If \\(R_0 &lt; 1\\): DFE is stable, the infection dies out (i.e. when infected, an individual infects less than one person on average, then the disease dies out) If \\(R_0 &gt; 1\\): EE is stable, there is an epidemic (i.e. when infected, an individual infects more than one person on average, then the disease spreads) References: [3] [12] [13] 3.5 Interactive Dashboard "],["compartmental-model-solutions.html", "Chapter 4 Compartmental Model Solutions 4.1 Solving with Jacobian Matrices and Eigenvalues 4.2 Routh - Hurwitz Criteria 4.3 Descartes’ Rule of Signs 4.4 Chapter 4 Notes + Linear Algebra Notes", " Chapter 4 Compartmental Model Solutions 4.1 Solving with Jacobian Matrices and Eigenvalues The stability of an equilibrium in a Compartmental Model is determined by the signage of the eigenvalues (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the Jacobian Matrix (J). In this Chapter, we will solve for the eigenvalues of the SI and SIR model. 4.1.1 SI and SIR Model Starting with the SIR Model, we have 3 compartments, thus, 3 differential equations. The equation below represents the balance of each compartment, totaling to 1. We can rearrange this to substitute R out, as shown below. \\[S+I+R=1 \\Rightarrow R=1-S-I\\] Now, we have our 3 system of equations, (\\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}, \\dot{R}\\)), in which \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\) represent Functions F and G respectively. By using the equation above we are able substitute R, and reduce our system from 3 to two equations, (\\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\)) \\[ \\begin{align*} \\dot{S} &amp;= F(S,I) \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= G(S,I) \\\\ \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha R \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma I - \\alpha R \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Our substitution results in these 2 equations for \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\): \\[\\begin{align} \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha(1-S-I) \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\end{align}\\] The Jacobian Matrix (J) represent a matrix of the partial derivatives of the system of Functions F and G. As stated before, this is represented by \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\) \\[J = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{dF}{dS} &amp; \\frac{dF}{dI} \\\\ \\frac{dG}{dS} &amp; \\frac{dG}{dI}\\end{bmatrix}\\] By substituting our system of equations, where \\(S^*\\) and \\(I^*\\) are the values of S and I at our specific equilibrium point, the Jacobian Matrix is as follows: \\[J = \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha &amp; -\\beta S^*-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I^* &amp; \\beta S^* - \\gamma\\end{bmatrix}\\] 4.1.2 Disease Free Equilibria The Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) is the state in which the disease has been eradicated, resulting in the values for \\(I^*\\) and \\(S^*\\) below. It is important to note that this equation must retain the balance from our earlier equation (\\(S+I+R = 0\\)), so \\(R^* = O\\). DFE: \\[I^* = 0, S^* = 1\\] We can substitute our values for \\(I^*\\) and \\(S^*\\) at the DFE into our Jacobian Matrix, shown before. \\[J_{DFE} = \\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}\\] Next, we take the determinant of the Jacobian Matrix. As shown below, to take the determinant of the Jacobian Matrix, we take our resulting Jacobian Matrix and subtract it by \\(\\lambda\\) multiplied by an Identity Matrix with the same dimensions as our Jacobian Matrix. Defining an Identity Matrix and the Procedure to Take the Determinant \\(det(J_{DFE} - \\lambda I) = 0\\), where I = Identity Matrix, and n represents the dimension of the matrix; in this case, n=2: Example: \\[\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix}=I_2\\] The first step, shown below, follows our previously stated processes. \\[det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}-\\lambda\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix})\\] Now, we distribute \\(\\lambda\\) across the identity matrix and subtract our Jacobian Matrix by the distributed Identity Matrix: \\[ det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix}-\\lambda &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\lambda\\end{bmatrix})=\\] \\[\\begin{align*} det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha-\\lambda &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda\\end{bmatrix}) \\end{align*}\\] To take the determinant, we follow this general rule of matrices in which we distribute each value: \\[\\begin{align*} det(\\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; B \\\\ C &amp; D\\end{bmatrix}) = AD-BC \\end{align*}\\] So, applying this rule: \\[det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha-\\lambda &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda\\end{bmatrix}) = -(\\alpha+\\lambda)(\\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda)-0=0\\] To solve for our eigenvalues, we set each factor to 0: \\[ \\begin{align*} -(\\alpha+\\lambda) &amp;= 0 \\\\ (\\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda) &amp;= 0 \\end{align*}\\] After solving, our resulting eigenvalues are: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\lambda &amp;= -\\alpha\\\\ \\lambda &amp;= \\beta-\\gamma \\end{align*}\\] Stability for the DFE An equilibrium is stable if all the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium have negative real parts. If any eigenvalue is positive, then the equilibrium is unstable. If some eigenvalues are zero and the rest are negative, then stability is inconclusive. This is denoted in the equations below. For Stability from \\(\\lambda_1\\) for the DFE: \\[\\lambda_1 = -\\alpha &lt; 0\\] For Stability from \\(\\lambda_2\\) for the DFE: In this equation, we also produce \\(R_0\\), in which we find the values for \\(R_O\\) in which the DFE is stable \\[\\lambda_2 = \\beta - \\gamma &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow \\beta&lt;\\gamma \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} = R_0 &lt; 1\\] The Disease Free Equilibrium is stable if \\(\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} = R_0 &lt; 1\\) 4.1.3 Endemic Equilibrium The Endemic Equilibrium represents the state in which the Disease persists. Our equations for \\(S^*\\) and \\(I^*\\) are as follows. These will be integral to solving the Jacobian Matrix for the Endemic Equilibrium: \\(S^*=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}=\\frac{1}{R_0}\\) only makes sense if \\(R_0&gt;1\\). Thus, if this equilibrium exists, the DFE is unstable. \\[\\begin{align*} I^* &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\\\ \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha(1-S-I) \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\end{align*}\\] Like previously, the Jacobian Matrix (J) represents a matrix of the partial derivatives of the system of Functions F and G. As stated before, this is represented by \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\). We are able to then subsitute our values for \\(S^*\\) and \\(I^*\\): \\[\\begin{align*} J &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I - \\alpha &amp; -\\beta S-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I &amp; \\beta S - \\gamma\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ J &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha &amp; -\\gamma-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*}\\] Next, we take the determinant, once again using the same process with the identity matrix: \\[ \\begin{align*} det(J-\\lambda I) = 0 \\\\ det(\\lambda I - J) = 0 \\end{align*}\\] After distributing \\(\\lambda\\) and combining the identity matrix with the Jacobian Matrix, we end up with: \\[det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I* - \\alpha -\\lambda &amp; -\\gamma-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I &amp; -\\lambda\\end{bmatrix})\\] Using the same general rule of distribution of matricies, we produce this equation: \\[(\\beta I^* + \\alpha + \\lambda)\\lambda + \\beta I^*(\\gamma+\\alpha) = 0\\] After distributing, the equation as follows is our characteristic equation, or a polynomial equation produced from the Jacobian Matrix, used to find eigenvalues. In this case, the characterisitic equation contains similar properties as a quadratic equation and will be treated as such when solving for eigenvalues. \\[\\lambda^2 + (\\beta I^* + \\alpha)\\lambda + \\beta I^*(\\gamma+\\alpha) = 0\\] Where \\(a=\\lambda^2, b=(\\beta I^* + \\alpha), c=\\beta I^*(\\gamma+\\alpha)\\) Substitute for \\(I^*\\): \\[\\lambda^2 + \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right] + \\alpha\\beta(1-\\frac{1}{R_0})=0\\] Subsitute a, b, c into quadratic equation: \\[\\lambda = \\frac{-\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right] \\pm \\sqrt{(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)^2 - 4\\beta I(\\gamma+\\alpha)}}{2}\\] Where \\(-\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right]\\) is negative due to the signage Here, we can expand the discriminant to understand complexity: \\[(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)^2 - 4\\beta I(\\gamma+\\alpha) = \\beta^2 (I^*)^2 + \\alpha^2 + 2\\beta(I^*)^2 - 4\\beta I \\alpha - 4\\beta I \\gamma\\] \\(\\lambda = \\frac{-b}{2}\\) \\(\\pm\\) Complex Number, where \\(\\frac{-b}{2}\\) is a real part. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\lambda &amp;= a \\pm bi \\\\ \\lambda_1 &amp;= a + bi \\\\ \\lambda_2 &amp;= a-bi \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] \\(Z=a+bi\\) where \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are real; \\(Re(Z)=\\) \\(a\\) real part of \\(Z\\), and \\(Im(Z)=\\) \\(b\\), imaginary number. \\[b^2&gt;b^2-4c&gt;0\\] \\[\\lambda_1=\\frac{{-b} + \\sqrt{(b^2 - 4c)^2}}{2}&lt;0\\] \\(\\lambda_2=\\frac{{-b} - \\sqrt{(b^2 - 4c)}}{2}\\) where \\(b^2&gt;b^2 - 4c\\), so \\[&lt;\\frac{{-b} - \\sqrt{b^2}}{2}=0\\] With this knowledge, we can apply this to our equation: \\[\\lambda = \\frac{-(\\beta I^*+\\alpha) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)^2 - 4\\beta I(\\gamma+\\alpha)}}{2}\\] Applying the rule, we are able to expand the discriminant: Notice the \\(\\pm\\) and only focus on \\(+\\) and drop \\(- 4\\beta I(\\gamma+\\alpha)\\) due to complexity \\[&lt;\\frac{-(\\beta I^*+\\alpha) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)^2}}{2}=\\frac{-(\\beta I^*+\\alpha)+{(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)}}{2}=0\\] As a result, since all coefficients of the characteristic equation are positive, as well as the resulting discriminant denoting negative real roots, both eigenvalues are real and negative. Thus, the Endemic Equilibrium is stable for \\(R_0&gt;1\\). 4.2 Routh - Hurwitz Criteria For stability, it must be shown that the real part of all the eigenvalues is negative. The Routh-Hourwitz Criteria provides a method to check if the eigenvalues are negative and the system is stable without needing to solve for the roots. Instead, the Routh-Herwitz criteria can determine if the eignenvalues are negative by looking at the coefficients. Depending on the degree of the polynomial, the criteria varies. For a quadratic characteristic equation \\[c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\] the coefficients must all be positive. As long as \\(c_2\\), \\(c_1\\), and \\(c_0\\) are positive the eigenvalues will be negative. The quadratic characteristic equation can be used when there are 3 compartments. The SIR model, with the susceptible, infected, and recovered compartment, can be used with the quadratic characteristic equation. For a cubic characteristic equation \\[c_3\\lambda^3+c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\] the criteria are slightly more complicated. Here the conditions that must be met are : \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_1c_2&gt;c_0c_3 \\\\ \\] And since c_3 = 1, the conditions are therefore: \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_1c_2&gt;c_0 \\\\ \\] As long as these conditions are met, it can be found that a cubic characteristic equation has only negative real parts and the system is therefore stable. A cubic characteristic equation can be used for models with 4 compartments such as the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model, SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Recovered) model, and the SIVR(Susceptible, Infected, Vaccinated, Recovered) model. For a quartic characteristic equation \\[c_4\\lambda^4+ c_3\\lambda^3+c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\] the criteria are further complicated. Here the conditions that must be met are : \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_2c_3&gt;c_1c_4 \\\\ c_1c_2c_3 - c_4c_1^2 &gt; c_0c_3^2 \\] As long as these conditions are met, it can be found that a quartic characteristic equation has only negative real parts and the system is therefore stable. 4.3 Descartes’ Rule of Signs Descartes’ Rule of Signs is used to determine the number of potential real positive and/or negative roots. \\[c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0 = 0\\] Using this general characterisitic equation, as seen when finding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian Matrix, we can understand how stable the equilibrium is in the system of differential equations. For stability to occur, all real roots and the real part of complex roots must be negative. 4.3.1 Case 1: Positive Roots with No Sign Changes \\[(+)(+)(+)\\] 0 sign changes from term to term All terms are positive, denoted by each coefficient (\\(c_0, c_1, c_2,\\)) being positive. Result: There are either 0 positive roots or 2 positive roots 4.3.2 Case 2: Negative Roots with Multiple Sign Changes \\[\\begin{align*} c_2(-\\lambda)^2+c_1(-\\lambda)+c_0=0 \\\\ c_2\\lambda^2-c_1\\lambda+c_0=0 \\end{align*}\\] 2 sign changes from term to term First term (\\(c_2\\lambda^2\\)) and last term (\\(c_0\\)) are positive, while middle term (\\(c_1\\lambda\\)) is negative From first to second term, \\(+\\) to \\(-\\), first sign change From second to third term, \\(-\\) to \\(+\\), second sign change Number of real negative roots = Number of sign changes Result: There are either 2 negative roots or 0 negative roots 4.3.3 Cases with One Sign Change: Example: \\((-) \\rightarrow (+) (+)\\)\\(\\cdots\\)\\(\\lambda \\rightarrow\\) 1 Positive Root 1 Sign Change and Positive Coefficients = 1 Real Positive Root \\((-) (-) \\rightarrow (+)\\)\\(\\cdots\\)\\(-\\lambda \\rightarrow\\) 1 Negative Root 1 Sign Change and Negative Coefficients = 1 Real Negative Root 4.4 Chapter 4 Notes + Linear Algebra Notes For \\(S(t)\\), \\(S=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\) DFE: \\(I^*=0\\), \\(S*=1\\) \\[S(t) =\\left[\\begin{align*}&amp;\\dot{S}= -\\beta SI + \\alpha I\\\\&amp;\\dot{S}=(-\\beta S \\gamma)(1-S)\\\\&amp;\\dot{I} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I\\\\&amp;J = -\\beta(1-S) - (-\\beta S + \\gamma) = -\\beta + \\beta S + \\beta S - \\gamma = 2\\beta S - \\beta - \\gamma\\\\&amp;J_{DFE} = -\\beta(1-1) - (-\\beta + \\gamma) = \\beta - \\gamma &lt; 0 \\rightarrow \\beta &lt; \\gamma = R_0 &lt; 1 \\\\&amp;J_{EE} = 2\\beta \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\right) - \\beta - \\gamma = 2\\gamma - \\beta - \\gamma = \\gamma - \\beta &lt; 0 \\rightarrow 1 &lt; R_0\\end{align*} \\right]\\] "],["sample-chapter-introduction-to-mathematical-modelling.html", "Chapter 5 Sample Chapter: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling 5.1 Foundations 5.2 Exponential Growth and Decay 5.3 Logistic Model", " Chapter 5 Sample Chapter: Introduction to Mathematical Modelling 5.1 Foundations Definition 5.1 (Model) A mathematical model is a mathematical framework describing a simplified version of reality. Some examples of mathematical models from Definition 5.1 include Population Growth Model: A model that describes how the size of a population changes over time depending on birth rates and death rates. Supply and Demand Model: A model in economics that relates the price of a good to its availability (supply) and how much people want it (demand). It predicts that the price will adjust until the amount supplied equals the amount demanded (market equilibrium). Projectile Motion Model: A physics model for the path of an object thrown into the air. Linear Regression Model: A statistical model that expresses the relationship between a response variable (like exam score) and one or more explanatory variables (like study hours). 5.2 Exponential Growth and Decay Exponential models describe processes that grow or decline at rates proportional to their current size. In the case of exponential growth, the model is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN, \\quad r &gt; 0, \\] which has the solution \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}. \\] When the rate \\(r\\) is negative, we obtain exponential decay, where the quantity decreases over time: \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}, \\quad r &lt; 0. \\] These models are widely used in contexts such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest. Figure 5.1: Exponential growth (left) and exponential decay (right) with initial value \\(N_0=10\\); rates \\(r=0.3\\) and \\(r=-0.3\\). 5.3 Logistic Model The logistic growth model describes how a population grows over time with limited resources. The differential equation form is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right), \\] where - \\(N(t)\\) = population size at time \\(t\\) - \\(r\\) = intrinsic growth rate - \\(K\\) = carrying capacity. The solution to this differential equation is \\[ N(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K - N_0}{N_0}\\right)e^{-rt}}, \\] where \\(N_0\\) is the initial population size at \\(t=0\\). As \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(N(t) \\to K\\), meaning the population stabilizes at the carrying capacity.
