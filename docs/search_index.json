Some examples of mathematical models include Population Growth Model: A model that describes how the size of a population changes over time depending on birth rates and death rates. Supply and Demand Model: A model in economics that relates the price of a good to its availability (supply) and how much people want it (demand). It predicts that the price will adjust until the amount supplied equals the amount demanded (market equilibrium). Projectile Motion Model: A physics model for the path of an object thrown into the air. Linear Regression Model: A statistical model that expresses the relationship between a response variable (like exam score) and one or more explanatory variables (like study hours). 1.2 Exponential Growth and Decay Exponential models describe processes that grow or decline at rates proportional to their current size. In the case of exponential growth, the model is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN, \\quad r &gt; 0, \\] which has the solution \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}. \\] When the rate \\(r\\) is negative, we obtain exponential decay, where the quantity decreases over time: \\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{rt}, \\quad r &lt; 0. \\] These models are widely used in contexts such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest. Figure 1.1: Exponential growth (left) and exponential decay (right) with initial value \\(N_0=10\\); rates \\(r=0.3\\) and \\(r=-0.3\\). 1.3 Logistic Model The logistic growth model describes how a population grows over time with limited resources. The differential equation form is \\[ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right), \\] where - \\(N(t)\\) = population size at time \\(t\\) - \\(r\\) = intrinsic growth rate - \\(K\\) = carrying capacity. The solution to this differential equation is \\[ N(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K - N_0}{N_0}\\right)e^{-rt}}, \\] where \\(N_0\\) is the initial population size at \\(t=0\\). As \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(N(t) \\to K\\), meaning the population stabilizes at the carrying capacity.
