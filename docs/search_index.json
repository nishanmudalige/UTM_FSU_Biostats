Definition 1.1 (Epidemic) An Epidemic is a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease at a particular time. Definition 1.2 (Endemic Disease) An Endemic disease is one that is always present in certain populations. One of the earliest and deadliest epidemics known is the Black Death, also known as the bubonic plague, which started in Asia in 1346 and spread throughout Europe. Another widely known epidemic is the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19 which caused more than 50 million deaths. Malaria and typhus are examples of endemic diseases (Definition 1.2). Most recently, COVID-19 caused a worldwide lockdown from 2020-2021, infecting 779 million and killing 7 million. The purpose of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease, predict its course, and develop ways of controlling its spread. The first model in mathematical epidemiology was the work of Daniel Bernoulli on the inoculation of smallpox. Bernoulli calculated the increase in life expectancy if smallpox were removed as a cause of death. The beginnings of compartmental modelling started through the work of public health physicians. In 1906, W.H. Hamer proposed that the spread of infection should be observed by looking at individuals in compartments: susceptible and infectious. Dr. Ronald Ross, who worked on malaria, was the first to introduce the concept of: Definition 1.3 (Basic Reproductive Number) The basic reproductive number (R0), which quantifies the number of secondary infections caused by one case in a susceptible population. The framework was then expanded and formalized by Kermack and McKendrick in the late 1920s and early 1930s, laying the foundation for modern epidemic modeling. [3] 1.4 Role of Models in Public Health Due to ethical concerns, it is difficult to design controlled experiments in epidemiology. In addition, epidemiologists may encounter incomplete and inaccurate data from measurement error, which can hinder parameter estimation and model fitting. [24] [4]. This is why mathematical modelling in epidemiology plays a major role in our understanding of mechanisms of disease spread. This understanding can suggest strategies for public health and health care responses regarding diseases and epidemics [23] [4] [21]. Models can also identify variables that data may not show. For instance, some models can identify threshold behaviors of epidemics—an indicator of when a disease will become an epidemic, or dies out [4]. These indicators are based on (R0) (Definition 1.3) in which, if the variable is above, below, or equal to 1, an epidemic (Definition 1.1) may occur, die out or become endemic (Definition 1.2), respectively. This information could then be used to determine vaccination plans within a population as well as individually [4]. Being able to understand the future spread of disease will give insurmountable advantages in developing a plan of action to combat new infections; additionally, the development of herd immunity (Definition 2.8) can safeguard an entire population through communal protection. Compartmental models used today (originating from the Kermack-McKendrick model), can show disease transmission while observing time and infection number in relation to an epidemic [23]. These models help understand diseases by dividing a population into compartments, such as the SIR model. These models utilize diverse mathematical equations and relationships to understand the flow and movementts between these models, defining these connections help predict the spread of disease regarding an outbreak. Compartmental models differ with diseases, and their development often relies on various policies. These models must undergo rigorous sensitivity testing to determine ideal parameters that impact model outcomes [21]. In Chapter 3 of this book, we will be exploring the models that are used in modern epidemiology, such as the SIR model [23]. "],["introduction-to-mathematical-models-in-epidemiology.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to Mathematical Models in Epidemiology 2.1 Defining Mathematical Models 2.2 Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking", " Chapter 2 Introduction to Mathematical Models in Epidemiology 2.1 Defining Mathematical Models The two major types of mathematical models used in epidemiology are deterministic models and stochastic models. Definition 2.1 (Deterministic Models) These models do not consider stochasticity (randomness), and predict results from known data (e.g. epidemic history; rules of models). These models are useful in large populations to observe epidemics in terms of the population and can help determine the fraction of individuals infected in an epidemic, as well as advise on disease control methods [5]. Deterministic models can be written in terms of differential equations in continuous time, or difference equations in discrete time. A common approach for continuous time deterministic models is Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These deterministic compartmental models will be introduced in Chapter 2, while Chapter 3 will discuss solving simple models and their behaviour. Definition 2.2 (Stochatsitc Models) These models account for stochasticity (randomness) and are able to capture variability in demographics and environment. These models are useful with small populations and can be used in determining how long a disease lasts, the probability of an epidemic, and distribution of behaviours [5]. Some types of stochastic models include Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Although stochastic models may better reflect reality, they are more labour-intensive to set-up than deterministic models and can also be more difficult to analyze. References: [4], [5] 2.2 Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking As varying global health concerns persist, it is imperative to understand the complexities within the spread of infectious diseases. The most prevalent of which is compartmental modelling. Definition 2.3 (Compartmental Model) This is a model that follows the change in proportions of populations in different compartments over time. The most common form of this type of model is the SIR model, organized in three separate compartments: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. Additional forms of this model may incorporate more compartments to attempt to enhance predictability. As computational power and modelling in the field of epidemiology have evolved, the growing use of parsimonious models, such as the SIR model, has become more relevant. Definition 2.4 (Parsimonious Models) These models utilize simpler processes by using accessible key data across broader conditions to produce a sufficiently predictive and generalizable model. [22] [26] 2.2.1 Approach to Compartmental Modelling Referring back, compartmental modelling (Definition 2.3) is the framework for prediction in epidemiology. The fundamental thinking behind the most common compartmental model, the SIR model, is that at any given point, a person will fall into either the Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered compartments, under the model’s assumptions. Definition 2.5 (Susceptible) Those at risk of the disease, but not yet infected Definition 2.6 (Infected) Those currently infected, and can actively spread the disease to those who are Susceptible Definition 2.7 (Recovered/Removed) Individuals who have recovered and developed immunity, or died from the disease Can either be denoted as Recovered or Removed, to account for all outcomes when leaving the “R” compartment. Either individuals are recovered, gaining immunity, and leave or die and leave, counting instead as removed Diving deeper, the relationship between each of these compartments is defined by differential equations, specifically ODEs and dynamical systems. These differential equations depict the movement between S and I, as well as I and R. The differential equations will show the flow of susceptible individuals to the infected compartment as the disease is transmitted at the transmission rate (\\(\\beta\\)) as well as the flow of infected individuals either back to the susceptible (Definition 2.5) compartment or to the recovered (Definition 2.7) compartment at the recovery rate(\\(\\gamma\\)). Other forms of the SIR model exist, in which compartments are added to depict realistic features of disease transmission. Each of these models utilizes an additional compartment that accounts for specific epidemiological situations, described below: SEIR: Exposed - Represents individuals who are infected but not yet infectious Accounts for the latency period, in which individuals may be infected, yet are not able to transmit the disease SAIR: Asymptomatic - Represents individuals who are infected but do not express symptoms Accounts for hidden transmission by individuals without symptoms SIRS: Susceptible - An additional “S” compartment at the end represents those who have recovered but lose immunity and become susceptible again Accounts for the misassumption that those who recover retain lifelong immunity SVIR: Vaccinated - Represents individuals who have received immunity to a varying extent from vaccinations Accounts for how vaccinations reduce the population of susceptible individuals These variations of the SIR model will be discussed at length in Chapter 5 and 6.1. [22] [26] Definition 2.8 (Herd Immunity) Herd immunity is acheived when a sufficiently large fraction of the population is immune, either through vaccination or recovery, so that disease transmission cannot be sustained within the community. Mathematically, this is expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number, \\(R_0\\) (Definition 1.3). If a proportion p of the population is immunized, the effective reproduction number becomes \\(R_0(1-p)\\). We will define the Effective Reproduction Number in Chapter 3 (Definition 3.5). To prevent the disease from becoming endemic (Definition 1.2), this effective reproduction number must be below one, leading to the inequality: \\(R_0(1-p) &lt;1\\) This inequality gives: \\(1-p&lt;\\frac{1}{R_0}\\) or \\(p&gt;1-\\frac{1}{R_0}\\) A population is said to have herd immunity (Definition 2.8) if a great enough fraction of the population has been immunized so that the disease cannot become endemic (Definition 1.2). An example of a disease that has been eradicated is smallpox. Smallpox was eradicated because it requires a lower percentage of the population to be immunized and therefore herd immunity was attainable. Measles, conversely, requires greater percentages of vaccination and the vaccine is not always effective which is why herd immunity against measles has not been achieved yet. These examples underscore how diseases with higher transmissibility require larger immunized fractions for herd immunity, a principle directly relevant to SVIR models where vaccination rates determine the system’s long-term equilibrium. 2.2.2 Benefits of Parsimonious Models As seen, SIR models and other forms can provide great predictive power. Recently, parsimonious models have become of interest in epidemiological modelling. These models are based on the premise that the simplest answer is the best. Allude to earlier in this section where parsimonious models are defined (Definition 2.4). These are able to use significantly less data and parameters in order to produce a generalized and understandable model. In a real-world setting, these models have been effectively utilized to predict disease outbreaks. Not only are these models more accurate than those with more complexity, but they can also be applied to a multitude of situations; additionally, with the presence of noisy data, these models can also avoid over fitting. [8] 2.2.3 Limitations of Compartmental Models While these models are effective at predicting and understanding the spread of disease, there are issues with both their simplicity and complexity. These models must use a vast amount of assumptions in order to be feasibly produced, which comes at the cost of precision and realism. Some of these assumptions include the interactions between humans, fixed parameters, and assumed immunity. In the real world, these assumptions are not constant or realistic, resulting in a model that may not accurately depict the spread of disease. As a result, additional compartments have been added, such as in SEIR, SAIR, SIRS, and SVIR models discussed earlier. However, the addition of more compartments creates further intricacies. The fundamental models discussed involve three to four compartments; other examples of models may contain a greater number of compartments. While this may improve the precision of the model, as discussed prior, real-world data is noisy. This may lead to over fitting the data, resulting in a lack of generalization and potentially reduced predictive ability.

In this chapter we will define model parameters and the flow between compartments. We will also seek mathematical solutions to the models to gain a comprehensive understanding of model initialization, functionality, and interpretation. The concepts discussed in this chapter provide a foundation for further analysis of epidemiological models explored in later chapters of this book. 3.2 Interactions Between Compartments Figure 3.1: The SI compartmental model. Defining Parameters: S : Proportion of population that is susceptible (Definition 2.5). I : Proportion of population that is infected (Definition 2.6). N : Total Population Differentials (\\(\\frac {dS}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac {dI}{dt}\\)): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments \\(\\beta SI\\): Total Rate of New Infections in a Population \\(\\beta\\): Transmission Rate \\(\\gamma I\\): Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals \\(\\gamma\\): Recovery Rate Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term: Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment Definition 3.1 (Flow) Flow is the movement of people move from one compartment to another. Compartmental models (Definition 2.3) are designed specifically to illustrate flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible (Definition 2.5) and Infectious (Definition 2.6) compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations. \\[ \\frac {dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI + \\gamma I \\] \\[ \\frac {dI}{dt} = +\\beta SI - \\gamma I \\] The signs in each equation indicate the direction of flow between compartments. For instance, \\(-\\beta SI\\) represents the loss of susceptible individuals as they become infected, while \\(+\\beta SI\\) represents the corresponding gain in the infectious group. The same relationship applies to \\(\\gamma I\\), which describes the recovery process in reverse. Understanding the parameters and signage then, one can understand the equations above. \\(\\frac {dS}{dt}\\) calculates the net flow of the susceptible group by subtracting the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by adding the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of the population entering the susceptible compartment). \\(\\frac {dI}{dt}\\) calculates the net flow of the infected group by adding the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by subtracting the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of people entering the susceptible compartment). These simple SI equations form the foundation for more complex models, such as SIR or SEIR, which introduce additional compartments to capture recovery, immunity, or incubation dynamics. [20] 3.3 Solving the SI Model In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible (Definition 2.5) or infected (Definition 2.6) and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through, it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant. The goal of solving the SIS model is to understand and predict the spread of an infectious disease within a population. Analyzing differential equations can help predict disease prevalence over time and determine whether a disease is endemic (Definition 1.2) or not. In addition, the differential equations can also be used to identify the size of infected (Definition 2.6) and susceptible (Definition 2.5) populations at the stable endemic state. By solving the differential equations, \\(S(t)\\) and \\(I(t)\\) can be found and used to predict the size of the susceptible and infected compartments at different periods in time. These are the initial assumptions in equation format, showing that within the population, an individual can either be in the susceptible or infected compartment. Together both compartments make up the total population, \\(N\\). \\[ S+I=N \\] In many of the compartmental models in this textbook, we let the populations be represented as a proportion, so \\(N = 1\\). As a result, \\(S\\) and \\(I\\) are both proportions of the population. \\[ S+I=1 \\] Rearranging this equation finds: \\[ I=1-S \\] Deriving both of the previous equations creates a system of differential equations: \\[ \\frac {dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI + \\gamma I \\] \\[ \\frac {dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\] Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1 by plugging in \\((1-S)\\) for \\(I\\): \\[ \\frac {dS} {dt}= -\\beta S(1-S) + \\gamma (1-S) = (\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S) \\] After separating the variables, we can take an integral of both sides to determine \\(S(t)\\). \\[ \\int \\frac {1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int dt \\] Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral: \\[ \\frac {A}{\\gamma - \\beta S} + \\frac {B}{1-S}= \\frac {A(1-S)+B( \\gamma - \\beta S)}{( \\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} \\] So then: \\[ A(1-S)+B( \\gamma - \\beta S) = 1 \\] In order to solve this equation, one can assume: \\[ A + \\beta \\gamma = 1 \\] \\[ A + B \\beta =0 \\] Through partial fractions it will be found that: \\[ A = \\frac {1}{\\beta - \\gamma } \\] \\[ B = \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\] Plugging in the new \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\[ \\int \\frac{1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\left(\\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta S}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\gamma - \\beta}\\left(\\frac {1}{1-S}\\right)dS \\] Solving the integral on the left side first results in: \\[ \\int \\frac{1}{(\\gamma - \\beta S)(1-S)} dS = \\int \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta - \\gamma}\\left(\\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta S}\\right) + \\frac{1}{\\gamma - \\beta}\\left(\\frac {1}{1-S}\\right)dS = \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\ln \\left| \\frac{\\gamma - \\beta S}{1-S} \\right| \\] Solving the integral on the right side results in: \\[ \\int dt = t +C \\] Therefore the new equation is: \\[ \\frac {1}{\\gamma - \\beta} \\ln \\left| \\frac{\\gamma - \\beta S}{1-S} \\right| = t+C \\] Solving for \\(S(t)\\) finds: \\[ S(t)= \\frac {\\gamma - Ce^{(\\gamma - \\beta )t}}{\\beta - Ce^{(\\gamma - \\beta)t}} \\] Then plugging in \\(t=0\\) and using \\(S_0\\) to solve for the constant : \\[ S(0) = \\frac {\\gamma - C}{\\beta -C} \\] \\[ S_0(\\beta - C) = \\gamma -C \\] \\[ S_0 \\beta - \\gamma = C(S_0 -1) \\] \\[ C = \\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1} \\] Plugging \\(C\\) into \\(S(t)\\) results in the final equation for \\(S(t)\\): \\[ S(t)= \\frac {\\gamma - (\\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1}) e^{(\\gamma - \\beta )t}}{\\beta - (\\frac{S_0 \\beta - \\gamma}{S_0 -1})e^{(\\gamma - \\beta)t}} \\] Thus through this work through of the SIS model, we have found a closed form solution for \\(S(t)\\), which shows the number or proportion of individuals in the susceptible compartment at a time t. Using the function found for \\(S(t)\\), one can plug it into the assumption equations, specifically \\(I+S=1\\), in order to find \\(I(t)\\). In addition, learning from this model, one can note that when \\(\\beta &gt; \\gamma\\), transmission is greater than recovery so there will be a spread of the infections and the disease will be endemic. However, when \\(\\beta &lt; \\gamma\\), recovery occurs faster than transmission and the disease will die out. Solving the SIS model not only provides a solution for \\(S(t)\\) and \\(I(t)\\), but also will provide a groundwork for more complex models, such as the SIR model . 3.4 Solving the SIR Model Building what we have learnt previously from solving the SI model, we will now attempt to solve the SIR model. Figure 3.2: The SIR compartmental model. The SIR model includes a new compartment, “R”, which represents recovery from infection; or alternatively, those removed from infection status. This removal can occur as a result of immunization from infection, immunity from recovering from the disease, isolation from the population, or death. Note that the latter demographic effects (birth/death) are not observed in our example, and different models can exist for those cases. We define a new system of differential equations for the SIR model as follows: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dS}{dt} = - \\beta SI + \\alpha R\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I\\) \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\alpha R\\) Defining the parameters: As before, the differentials represent the net flow of individuals in and out of compartments, and \\(\\beta\\) represents infection rate (S to I). \\(\\gamma\\) represents recovery rate of the infected, but now individuals moving out of compartment “I” (infected) move into compartment “R” (recovered/removed). \\(\\alpha\\) is a new term in the equations that represents the re-susceptible rate where recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again (R to S). Note that \\(S,I,R \\in [0,1]\\). If the population is represented by \\(N = S + I + R\\), we can let \\(N = 1\\) and get \\(S + I + R = 1\\). So \\(R = 1 - S - I\\). Plugging into the system of equations we get: \\[ \\frac{dS}{dt} = - \\beta SI + 2(1 - S - I) \\] However, unlike the SI model, the SIR model’s system of equations has no closed form solution. Instead, we can find the equilibrium for this system. This system is considered to be a dynamical system, and our analysis will be qualitative. Definition 3.2 (Equilibrium) The rate of individuals entering a compartment is equal to the rate of individuals leaving a compartment. Thus, we can set each equation in our system of equations to 0. The new system of equations at equilibria: \\(0 = -\\beta SI + \\alpha R\\) \\(0 = \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\Rightarrow 0 = (\\beta S - \\gamma) I\\) \\(0 = -\\gamma I + \\alpha R\\) There are two types of equilibrium in epidemiology: Definition 3.3 (Disease Free Equilibria (DFE)) There are no infected in the population, so \\(I* = 0\\) in our SIR model (notation: asterix indicates equilibrium solution) Definition 3.4 (Endemic Equilibria (EE)) Infected (Definition 2.6) persist indefinitely, so \\(I* &gt; 0\\) in our SIR model (notation: asterix indicates equilibrium solution) First we solve for DFE. From equation 2 we get: \\(I = 0\\), or \\(S=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\) Then plugging in \\(I = 0\\) into the system of equations: \\(0 = \\alpha R\\) \\(0 = -\\alpha R\\) Solving for \\(R\\) from these 2 equations, we get \\(R^* = 0\\) Since \\(R = 1 - S - I\\), \\(R^* = 0\\), and \\(I = 0\\), then \\(S^* = 1\\) (note: another way to write \\(S^*\\) is \\(\\overline S\\)). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation. Therefore, at Equilibrium (Definition 3.2): \\[ (S^*, I^*) = (1, 0) \\] Thus, at DFE (Definition 3.3), the entire population is susceptible to infection and no EE (Definition 3.4) exists because the infectious population returns to zero once the endemic is over. Now, we solve for EE. Plugging \\(S = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\) into the system of equations (equation 3): \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 &amp;= -\\gamma I + \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} - I \\right) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= \\gamma I - \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} - I \\right) \\\\ \\ \\alpha \\left(1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} \\right) &amp;= I (\\gamma + \\alpha) \\end{align*} \\] Solving for I we get: \\[ I^* = \\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\] Endemic equilibrium (EE) (Definition 3.4) is: \\[ (S^*, I^*) = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}, \\frac{\\alpha (1- \\gamma/\\beta)}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\right) \\] where \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta\\). EE (Definition 3.4) requires a continuous supply of susceptible (Definition 2.5) (“susceptible replacement”), for instance, by birth, or reduced immunity to the disease. Otherwise, I will approach 0 after the endemic. Also, since \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta\\), we get \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &gt; 1\\). The basic reproduction number (\\(R_0\\)) (Definition 1.3) is a threshold quantity that indicates the occurrence of an epidemic. \\(R_0\\) can also be thought of as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected (Definition 2.6) individual in a population of susceptible (Definition 2.5) individuals (e.g. at initial time \\(t = 0\\)). Note that individual variation is excluded in the definition. Specific values of \\(R_0\\) (Definition 1.3) can be used to analyze the stability of equilibrium (Definition 3.2). This will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 4, but more generally for now: If \\(R_0 &lt; 1\\): DFE is stable, the infection dies out (i.e. when infected, an individual infects less than one person on average, then the disease dies out) If \\(R_0 &gt; 1\\): EE is stable, there is an epidemic (i.e. when infected, an individual infects more than one person on average, then the disease spreads) References: [4] [2] [12] 3.4.1 Effective Reproduction Number While the basic reproduction number (\\(R_0\\)) represents the average number of secondary infections generated by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population, this assumption rarely holds true in real-world outbreaks. Over time, as immunity builds and interventions are introduced, the actual transmission potential changes. To capture this dynamic, epidemiologists use the effective reproduction number, \\(R_e\\) (or \\(R_t\\) measured at a time t). Definition 3.5 (Effective Reproduction Number) \\(R_e\\) quantifies the number of secondary cases expected per infection at time \\(t\\), accounting for the current level of susceptibility and external factors such as vaccination, behavioral changes, or public health measures. Going forward this will be our more detailed definition of \\(R_e\\). It is related to \\(R_0\\) through the proportion of the population that remains susceptible: \\[ R(t) = \\frac{S(t)}{S(0)} R_0 \\] This equation shows the temporal decline in the epidemic (Definition 1.1) due to depletion of susceptible (Definition 2.5) individuals. Monitoring \\(R_e\\) (Definition 3.5) over time provides a statistical framework for assessing how disease transmission responds to interventions or natural immunity accumulation. In this sense, \\(R_e\\) serves as a bridge between theoretical epidemic models and real-time epidemiological data, allowing researchers to evaluate and predict time-dependent trends in disease spread.

Chapter 4 will expand on the topic of equilibrium through linear stability analysis. Definition 4.1 (Linear Stability Analysis) A method providing the local stability of each equilibrium, as we approximate the solutions near the equilibrium. The approach to linear stability analysis involves determining the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at the given equilibrium. We can linearize the system of equations around the equilibria with the Jacobian matrix and find the characteristic polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues. We will show that all the eigenvalues have negative real parts to maintain the local stability of the equilibrium. See Chapter 1.2 for the recommended linear algebra and calculus background. This chapter will explore both the direct calculation of eigenvalues, as well as some alternative / indirect methods of showing stability. References: [4] [2] 4.2 Linear Stability Analysis for the SIR Model The stability of an equilibrium in a compartmental model (Definition 2.3) is determined by the signage of the eigenvalues (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the Jacobian Matrix (J). In this section, we will solve for the eigenvalues of the SIR model at the Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE) and the Endemic Equilibrium (EE). 4.2.1 Direct Calculation The SIR model has 3 compartments, and thus, 3 differential equations. The equation below represents the balance of each compartment, totaling to 1. We can rearrange this to substitute R out, as shown below. \\[S+I+R=1 \\Rightarrow R=1-S-I\\] Now, we have our 3 system of equations, (\\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}, \\dot{R}\\)), in which \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\) represent Functions F and G respectively. By using the equation above we are able substitute R, and reduce our system from 3 to two equations, (\\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\)) \\[ \\begin{align*} \\dot{S} &amp;= F(S,I) = -\\beta SI + \\alpha R \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= G(S,I) = \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma I - \\alpha R \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Our substitution results in these 2 equations for \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\): \\[\\begin{align} \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha(1-S-I) \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I \\end{align}\\] The Jacobian Matrix (J) represent a matrix of the partial derivatives of the system of Functions F and G. As stated before, this is represented by \\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\) \\[J = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{dF}{dS} &amp; \\frac{dF}{dI} \\\\ \\frac{dG}{dS} &amp; \\frac{dG}{dI}\\end{bmatrix}\\] By substituting our system of equations, where \\(S^*\\) and \\(I^*\\) are the values of S and I at our specific equilibrium point, the Jacobian Matrix is as follows: \\[J = \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha &amp; -\\beta S^*-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I^* &amp; \\beta S^* - \\gamma\\end{bmatrix}\\] 4.2.1.1 At Disease-Free Equilibrium The Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) (Definition 3.3) is the state in which the disease has been eradicated. Therefore, at DFE, \\(I^* = 0\\) and \\(S^* = 1\\). It is important to note that this equation must retain the balance from our earlier equation (\\(S+I+R = 0\\)), so \\(R^* = O\\). We can substitute our values for \\(I^*\\) and \\(S^*\\) at the DFE into our Jacobian Matrix before, so we get: \\[J_{DFE} = \\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}\\] Next, we solve for the eigenvalues of the Jacobian Matrix by the formula \\(det(J-\\lambda I_n) = 0\\), where \\(det\\) is the determinant, \\(J\\) is the Jacobian Matrix, \\(\\lambda\\) is the eigenvalue, and \\(I_n\\) is the identity matrix with \\(n\\) dimensions. Adding in the \\(J\\) we solved for above and the identity matrix \\(I_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix}\\), we get: \\[ 0 = det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}-\\lambda\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix}) \\] We will now simplify the contents of the determinant using matrix operations. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 &amp;= det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma\\end{bmatrix}+\\begin{bmatrix}-\\lambda &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\lambda\\end{bmatrix}) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= det(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\alpha-\\lambda &amp; -\\beta-\\alpha \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda\\end{bmatrix}) \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Evaluate the determinant of the matrix by the rule \\(det \\left(\\begin{bmatrix} A &amp; B \\\\ C &amp; D\\end{bmatrix} \\right) = AD-BC\\). Applying this rule, we get: \\[ 0 = -(\\alpha+\\lambda)(\\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda) \\] Then, solve for the two eigenvalues. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 =-(\\alpha+\\lambda_1) &amp;\\longrightarrow \\lambda_1 = -\\alpha\\\\ \\ 0 =(\\beta-\\gamma-\\lambda_2) &amp;\\longrightarrow \\lambda_2 = \\beta-\\gamma \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Therefore, the eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = -\\alpha\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = \\beta-\\gamma\\). Definition 4.2 (Equilibrium Stability by Eigenvalues) The equilibrium is stable if all the eigenvalues have negative real parts. The equilibrium is unstable is any eigenvalue is positive. The equilibrium stability is inconclusive if some eigenvalues are zero and the rest are negative. Stability Analysis of eigenvalues at DFE using Definition 4.2: For DFE to be stable, we will show both the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) have negative real parts. Showing \\(\\lambda_1\\) has negative real parts: \\[(\\lambda_1 = -\\alpha) &lt; 0\\] Showing \\(\\lambda_2\\) has negative real parts: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ (\\lambda_2 = \\beta - \\gamma) &amp;&lt; 0 \\\\ \\ \\beta &amp;&lt; \\gamma \\\\ \\ \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &amp;&lt; 1 \\\\ \\ R_0 &amp;&lt; 1 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Therefore, we have shown that the eigenvalues have negative real parts and also obtain that the Disease Free Equilibrium is stable when \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &lt; 1\\) 4.2.1.2 At Endemic Equilibrium The Endemic Equilibrium (Definition 3.4) represents the state in which the disease persists. Recall from Chapter 3.4 that at EE, we solve the system of equations (\\(\\dot{S}, \\dot{I}\\)) where \\(R = 1-S-I\\) and obtain (\\(S^*\\), \\(I^*\\)). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha(1-S-I) &amp;\\Longrightarrow S^* &amp;=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} \\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I &amp;\\Longrightarrow I^* &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Note that since \\(S^*=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}=\\frac{1}{R_0}\\), we have \\(R_0&gt;1\\). Thus, if EE exists, the DFE is unstable. We substitute our value for \\(S^*\\) into the Jacobian Matrix we defined at the start of Chapter 4.2.1. For simplicity, we will keep \\(I^*\\) as is for now. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ J &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha &amp; -\\beta S^*-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I^* &amp; \\beta S^* - \\gamma\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ J_{EE} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha &amp; -\\gamma-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I^* &amp; 0\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] To solve for the eigenvalues of the Jacobian Matrix, we follow the same approach used earlier for the DFE. Use the formula \\(det(J-\\lambda I_n) = det(\\lambda I_n -J) = 0\\), and further simplify by matrix operations and determinant rules. We obtain the following: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 &amp;= det \\left(\\begin{bmatrix}-\\beta I^* - \\alpha -\\lambda &amp; -\\gamma-\\alpha \\\\ \\beta I &amp; -\\lambda\\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= -(\\beta I^* + \\alpha + \\lambda) (-\\lambda) + (\\beta I^*) (\\gamma+\\alpha) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= \\lambda^2 + (\\beta I^* + \\alpha)\\lambda + \\beta I^*(\\gamma+\\alpha) \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Finally we substitute \\(I^*\\) into the equation and get: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ 0 &amp;= \\lambda^2 + \\left[ \\beta \\left(\\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\right) + \\alpha \\right] \\lambda + \\beta \\left( \\frac{\\alpha (1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta})}{\\gamma + \\alpha} \\right) (\\gamma+\\alpha) \\\\ \\ 0 &amp;= \\lambda^2 + \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right]\\lambda + \\alpha\\beta \\left(1-\\frac{1}{R_0} \\right) \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The equation above is the characteristic equation, a polynomial equation produced from the Jacobian Matrix. This characteristic equation can be solved to find the eigenvalues. In this case, because the characteristic equation is a quadratic equation, we can apply the quadratic formula to solve for the eigenvalues. Recall the quadratic formula: \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} {2a}\\] We have \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right]\\), and \\(c=\\alpha\\beta \\left(1-\\frac{1}{R_0} \\right)\\). Substituting a, b, and c into quadratic formula: \\[\\lambda = \\frac{-\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right] \\pm \\sqrt{(\\beta I^* + \\alpha)^2 - 4\\beta I(\\gamma+\\alpha)}}{2}\\] The general solution to the eigenvalues is represented by \\(\\lambda = \\frac{-b}{2}\\) \\(\\pm\\) Complex Number, where \\(\\frac{-b}{2}\\) is the real part. Therefore we get the two eigenvalues of the form \\(\\lambda_1 = v + wi\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = v-wi\\), where \\(Re(\\lambda)=v\\) represents the real part, \\(Im(\\lambda)=w\\) represents the complex part, and \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\) is the imaginary number. The complex part only exists if the sign of the discriminant is negative. Stability Analysis of eigenvalues at EE using Definition 4.2: For EFE to be stable, we will show both the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) have negative real parts. Since eigenvalues of EE may potentially have a complex part, we must consider both the real and complex parts when interpreting stability. We know that the real part is negative from the signage of \\(b = -\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{R_0 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} + 1 \\right]\\). By Definition 4.2 we know this indicates that the EE is stable. To further our understanding, we can consider the case where the complex part exists. If \\(c &gt; 0\\), then \\(0 &lt; b^2 - 4c &lt; b^2\\). Recall that \\(a = 1\\). Then: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\lambda_1 &amp;= \\frac{{-b} - \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} &lt; 0 \\\\ \\lambda_2 &amp;=\\frac{{-b} + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2} &lt; \\left( \\frac{{-b} + \\sqrt{b^2}}{2}=0 \\right) \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Therefore we have shown that the eigenvalues are negative when the complex part is present or absent, so the Endemic Equilibrium is stable when c&gt;0. 4.2.2 A Note on Phase Diagrams A phase diagram is a visual representation of the conditions that can occur at equilibrium. The phase diagram for the SIR model consists of a simplex where the diagonal line represents the boundary of no recovered individuals, and the origin represents the point at which all individuals are recovered. The space within the simplex is when there are some recovered individuals. The equilibrium exists somewhere within this simplex. Different phase diagrams can exist depending on the conditions: When \\(R_0 &lt; 1\\), a single equilibrium exists: DFE. The phase diagram will have a stable node, in which trajectory of the solution goes towards the equilibrium. When \\(R_0 &gt; 1\\), two equilibrium exist: DFE and EE. DFE is always an unstable node and EE is either a stable node or a stable spiral The trajectory of the solution goes from the unstable DFE to the stable EE. Whether EE is a spiral depends on whether a complex solution exists for the eigenvalues. If the discriminant is negative, a complex value is present and a stable spiral will occur. If the discriminant is nonnegative, there is no complex number and a stable node will occur. 4.2.2.1 Interactive Dashboard Adjust the parameters of the dashboard below to change the conditions of stability and see the different phase diagrams that are possible for the SIR model. 4.2.3 Routh-Hurwitz Criteria For stability, it must be shown that the real part of all the eigenvalues is negative (Definition 4.2). Definition 4.3 (Routh-Hurwitz Criteria) A method to check if the eigenvalues are negative and the system is stable without needing to solve for the roots. The criteria can determine if the eigenvalues are negative by looking at the coefficients. Depending on the degree of the polynomial, the criteria varies. We will consider stability analysis for different characteristic polynomials using the Routh-Hurwitz Criteria (Definition 4.3). 4.2.3.1 Quadratic Characteristic Equation For a quadratic characteristic equation, \\(c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\), the coefficients must all be positive. As long as \\(c_2\\), \\(c_1\\), and \\(c_0\\) are positive the eigenvalues will be negative. The quadratic characteristic equation can be used when there are 3 compartments. The SIR model, with the susceptible, infected, and recovered compartment, can be used with the quadratic characteristic equation. 4.2.3.2 Cubic Characteristic Equation For a cubic characteristic equation, \\(c_3\\lambda^3+c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\), the criteria are slightly more complicated. Here the conditions that must be met are : \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_1c_2&gt;c_0c_3 \\\\ \\] And since \\(c_3 = 1\\), the conditions are therefore: \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_1c_2&gt;c_0 \\\\ \\] As long as these conditions are met, it can be found that a cubic characteristic equation has only negative real parts and the system is therefore stable. A cubic characteristic equation can be used for models with 4 compartments such as the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model, SAIR (Susceptible, Asymptomatic, Infected, Recovered) model, and the SIVR(Susceptible, Infected, Vaccinated, Recovered) model. 4.2.3.3 Quartic Characteristic Equation For a quartic characteristic equation, \\(c_4\\lambda^4+ c_3\\lambda^3+c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0=0\\), the criteria are further complicated. Here the conditions that must be met are: \\[ c_i&gt;0 \\\\ c_2c_3&gt;c_1c_4 \\\\ c_1c_2c_3 - c_4c_1^2 &gt; c_0c_3^2 \\] As long as these conditions are met, it can be found that a quartic characteristic equation has only negative real parts and the system is therefore stable. 4.2.4 Descartes’ Rule of Signs Definition 4.4 (Descartes' Rule of Signs) A method to determine the number of potential real positive and/or negative roots. We will apply Descartes’ Rule of Signs (Definition 4.4) for stability analysis to the following characteristuc equation. \\[c_2\\lambda^2 + c_1\\lambda + c_0 = 0\\] Using this general characterisitic equation, as seen when finding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian Matrix, we can understand how stable the equilibrium is in the system of differential equations. For stability to occur, all real roots and the real part of complex roots must be negative (Definition 4.2). 4.2.4.1 Case 1: Positive Roots with No Sign Changes \\[(+)(+)(+)\\] 0 sign changes from term to term All terms are positive, denoted by each coefficient (\\(c_0, c_1, c_2,\\)) being positive. Result: There are either 0 positive roots 4.2.4.2 Case 2: Negative Roots with Multiple Sign Changes \\[\\begin{align*} c_2(-\\lambda)^2+c_1(-\\lambda)+c_0=0 \\\\ c_2\\lambda^2-c_1\\lambda+c_0=0 \\end{align*}\\] 2 sign changes from term to term First term (\\(c_2\\lambda^2\\)) and last term (\\(c_0\\)) are positive, while middle term (\\(c_1\\lambda\\)) is negative From first to second term, \\(+\\) to \\(-\\), first sign change From second to third term, \\(-\\) to \\(+\\), second sign change Number of real negative roots = Number of sign changes Result: There are either 2 negative roots or 0 negative roots 4.2.4.3 Cases with One Sign Change: Example: \\((-) \\rightarrow (+) (+)\\)\\(\\cdots\\)\\(\\lambda \\rightarrow\\) 1 Positive Root 1 Sign Change and Positive Coefficients = 1 Real Positive Root \\((-) (-) \\rightarrow (+)\\)\\(\\cdots\\)\\(-\\lambda \\rightarrow\\) 1 Negative Root 1 Sign Change and Negative Coefficients = 1 Real Negative Root 4.3 Linear Stability Analysis for the SI Model An additional example is provided for the stability analysis of the SI model. \\(R_0\\) is used to analyze the stability of this simpler model. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\beta SI + \\alpha I =(-\\beta S \\gamma)(1-S)\\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\gamma I\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Solving the Jacobian: \\[ det(J) = -\\beta(1-S) - (-\\beta S + \\gamma) = 2\\beta S - \\beta - \\gamma \\] At DFE, \\(I^*=0\\), \\(S^*=1\\), so: \\[ det(J_{DFE}) = 2\\beta (1) - \\beta - \\gamma = \\beta - \\gamma \\] \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\beta - \\gamma &amp;&lt; 0 \\\\ \\ \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &amp;&lt; 1 \\\\ \\ R_0 &amp;&lt; 1 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] At EE, \\(S=\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\), so: \\[ det(J_{EE}) = 2\\beta \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta} \\right) - \\beta - \\gamma = \\gamma - \\beta \\] \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\gamma -\\beta &amp;&lt; 0 \\\\ \\ \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &amp;&gt; 1 \\\\ \\ R_0 &amp;&gt; 1 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] "],["next-generation-matrix.html", "Chapter 5 Next Generation Matrix 5.1 Introduction to the Chapter 5.2 Solving the SEIR Model 5.3 Solving the SEIR Model with Birth and Death 5.4 Visualizing the SEIR Models", " Chapter 5 Next Generation Matrix 5.1 Introduction to the Chapter This chapter describes in depth the use of the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. This tool is used to calculate the \\(R_0\\) value (Definition 1.3). Using the NGM achieves this this for multi-compartmental models (e.g. SEIR), by linearizing the system of differential equations around the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) and dividing the flow of disease (Definition 3.1) into what causes new cases and what accounts for everything else that happens to an infected person. It is also important to mention that these tools are not limited to specific models and can be used for a variety of models. This chapter will use the SEIR model as an example for applying the NGM method (recall the SEIR model from Chapter 2.2.1). 5.2 Solving the SEIR Model 5.2.1 Definining the SEIR Model and Parameters The SEIR model expands on our previous SIR model with the additional compartment “Exposed”. This compartment represents individuals in the population that have been infected, but are not yet infectious. Figure 5.1: The SEIR compartmental model. We begin by defining \\(X\\) as the vector of disease compartments. Then we can have: \\[\\frac{dX}{dt} = F(x) - V(x)\\] \\(F(x)\\) is a vector of the terms that lead to new infections \\(V(x) = V^- (x) -V^+ (x)\\) where \\(V^- (x)\\) and \\(-V^+ (x)\\) contain all other outputs and inputs, respectively, for each disease compartment For instance, the SIR model has \\(X = \\begin{bmatrix} I \\end{bmatrix}\\). We define \\(X\\) for the SEIR model as: \\(X = \\begin{bmatrix} E\\\\ I\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\). We also define the differential equations for the SEIR model: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= - \\beta SI \\\\ \\ \\dot{E} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\delta E \\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\delta E - \\gamma I \\\\ \\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma I \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] 5.2.2 Defining the Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE) The Disease Free Equilibrium (Definition 3.3) exists when all infected compartments are set to 0. In other words, \\(E=0\\) and \\(I=0\\). First, set all differential equations equal to zero. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= - \\beta SI = 0\\\\ \\ \\dot{E} &amp;= \\beta SI - \\delta E = 0 \\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\delta E - \\gamma I = 0\\\\ \\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma I = 0\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] At the DFE: \\(\\dot{S} = 0\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) \\(\\dot{E} = 0\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) and \\(E=0\\) \\(\\dot{I} = 0\\) is true when \\(E=0\\) and \\(I=0\\) \\(\\dot{R} = 0\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) Since there are no infections, \\(E=I=R=0\\). This means that for \\(N=S+E+I+R\\), \\(N=S\\) due to our earlier statements. So at the DFE for the \\((S,E,I,R) = (N,0,0,0)\\). This is important for understanding later substitutions in the Chapter. 5.2.3 Solving SEIR Model with NGM Recall that for the SEIR model the disease compartments are \\(E\\) and \\(I\\), so \\(\\dot{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{E}\\\\ \\dot{I}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\). Substitute the differential equations for \\(\\dot{E}\\) and \\(\\dot{I}\\) into \\(X\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{E}\\\\ \\dot{I}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI - \\delta E \\\\ \\delta E - \\gamma I \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} - \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\delta E \\\\ \\gamma I \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\delta E \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\\\ \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= F(x) - ( V^- (x) -V^+ (x) ) \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Note that the 0 in \\(F(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) exists because \\(F\\) only considers brand new infected (the flow from \\(S \\rightarrow E\\) and not \\(S \\rightarrow I\\)). In other words, new infected are not necessarily infectious. We separated \\(\\dot{X}\\) into components to assist us in our \\(R_0\\) calculations. For further simplicity, we also let: \\(F(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(V(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\delta E \\\\ \\gamma I - \\delta E \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\\\ V_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) Next, we find the Jacobian Matrices of \\(F(x)\\) and \\(V(x)\\) at the DFE. (Recall Jacobians from Chapter 4.2). Let the Jacobian of F(x) be F. \\[ \\boldsymbol{F} = J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta S \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Since we defined the DFE earlier as \\((S,E,I,R) = (N,0,0,0)\\), and we let population \\(N = 1\\), we then get \\(S=1\\) at DFE. Substituting \\(S=1\\) in, we get: \\[ J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Let the Jacobian of V(x) be V. \\[ \\boldsymbol{V} = J_V (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\delta &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\delta &amp; \\gamma \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Another way to think about it: \\(\\dot{X} = (f-v) \\begin{bmatrix} E \\\\ I \\end{bmatrix} = (f-v)X\\) We will now find the NGM. Definition 5.1 (Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method) A method to determine the \\(R_0\\) value for compartmental models. Formula: \\(NGM = \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1}\\) Using the NGM formula from (Definition 5.1), we obtain the NGM for the SEIR model with our previously determined F and V. To find \\(\\boldsymbol{V} ^{-1}\\) we use the following rule: for matrix \\(M = \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\), the inverse matrix is \\(M^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) Then, we have \\(\\boldsymbol{F} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{V} ^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\gamma} \\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma &amp; 0 \\\\ \\delta &amp; \\delta \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ NGM = \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V} ^{-1} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\delta \\gamma} \\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma &amp; 0 \\\\ \\delta &amp; \\delta \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\delta} &amp; 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} &amp; \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Refer back to the formula in Chapter 4.2.1.1, where \\(det(J-\\lambda I_n) = 0\\). \\(R_0\\) is the spectral radius (i.e. largest eigenvalue) of \\(\\ \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V} ^{-1}\\). \\[ det \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} - \\lambda &amp; \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} \\\\ 0 &amp; - \\lambda \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = - \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} - \\lambda \\right) \\] Let \\(- \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} - \\lambda \\right) = 0\\). So \\(\\lambda = 0\\) and \\(\\lambda = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\). The latter is the largest eigenvalue, so \\(R_0 = \\lambda = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\). Thus, we have obtained the \\(R_0\\) using the NGM method. 5.3 Solving the SEIR Model with Birth and Death In this version of the SEIR model, demographic effects such as births and deaths (also known as vital dynamics) are included to increase model realism. \\(\\mu N\\) represents births \\(\\mu\\) represents deaths The birth term \\(\\mu N\\) adds to the susceptible population, while the deaths occur at a rate \\(\\mu\\) across the four compartments. Figure 5.2: The SEIR compartmental model. The four differential equations for the SEIR model with vital dynamics can then be constructed. Also recall that \\(S+E+I+R=N\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\dot{S} &amp;= \\mu N - \\frac{\\beta SI}{N} \\\\ \\dot{E} &amp;= \\frac{\\beta SI}{N} - (\\sigma + \\mu)E \\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\sigma E - (\\gamma + \\mu)I \\\\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma I - \\mu R \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] At the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), there are no infections (\\(E = 0\\) and \\(I = 0\\)). We then set all differential equations equal to 0, and \\(E = 0\\) and \\(I = 0\\). Therefore at the DFE, we obtain \\(\\dot{S} = 0\\) when \\(S = N\\), which means the entire population is susceptible. We use this equilibrium to linearize the system and separate infection terms (\\(F(x)\\)) from other transition terms (\\(V(x)\\)). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\dot{X} &amp;= F(x) - V(x) \\\\ &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\beta SI}{N} \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} (\\sigma + \\mu)E \\\\ (\\gamma + \\mu)I - \\sigma E \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] Here, the first vector \\(F(x)\\) captures new infections — in this case, the flow from the susceptible compartment \\(S\\) to the exposed compartment \\(E\\). The second vector, \\(V(x)\\), represents all other movements between infected compartments (progression, recovery, and death). The Jacobian of \\(F(x)\\) is the following, where the right-most matrix is obtained when \\(S = N\\) at DFE: \\[ \\boldsymbol{F} = J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\frac{\\beta S}{N} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;\\beta \\\\0&amp;0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] The Jacobian of \\(V(x)\\) is \\[ \\boldsymbol{V} = J_V (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma + \\mu &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sigma &amp; \\gamma + \\mu \\end{bmatrix} \\] Lastly, we obtain the NGM by following Definition 5.1: \\[ \\begin{align*} NGM = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; \\beta \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{(\\sigma + \\mu)(\\gamma + \\mu)} \\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma + \\mu &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sigma &amp; \\sigma + \\mu \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{(\\sigma + \\mu)(\\gamma + \\mu)} &amp; \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma + \\mu} \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] Multiplying \\(F\\) by \\(V^{-1}\\) captures how many new infections one infected individual generates in each compartment over their infectious period. The resulting matrix describes the expected number of new infections caused by an exposed or infectious person. The basic reproduction number \\(R_0\\) is given by the the largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix. Therefore: \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta \\sigma}{(\\sigma + \\mu)(\\gamma +\\mu)}\\) This value shows how the disease’s ability to spread depends not only on transmission (\\(\\beta\\)) and recovery (\\(\\gamma\\)), but also on the rates of progression (\\(\\sigma\\)) and death (\\(\\mu\\)). If \\(\\mu = 0\\), meaning no births or deaths occur, this expression simplifies to \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\) which is the classic SIR result.

We used the following parameters in these plots: initial population size: \\(N = 500\\) transmission rate: \\(\\beta = 0.4\\) progression rate from exposed to infected: \\(\\delta = \\sigma = 0.27\\) recovery rate: \\(\\gamma = 0.10\\) death rate: \\(\\mu = 0.0001\\) (only used in Figure 5.4) Figures 5.3 and 5.4 visualize the differences on a disease model that the presence of vital dynamics can have, despite the rest of the parameters being the same. Also, note the difference in the time scales between the plots.

These models are derived from scholarly articles and experiments in which the parameters, variables, and differential equations are provided. In this, we can apply our knowledge and techniques from previous chapters to analyze different compartmental models. After solving and analyzing these models, we will also look at some specific examples to understand the usage of these models with real data. 6.2 The SIQR Model This model is based on the parameters and variables defined in the article by Kalachev et al. (2023) and is used to model COVID-19. [11] The “Q” compartment represents quarantined individuals. It is important to note that the authors state their limitations, as they do not include an “E” (Exposed) compartment. This means that the complexities of the case in question, COVID-19, is not fully modeled. However, for our purposes, this pre-existing model provides definitive parameters and variables to be manipulated and solved. Figure 6.1: The SIQR compartmental model. 6.2.1 Defining the Parameters \\(\\alpha\\): infection rate \\(\\beta\\): quarantine rate \\(\\gamma\\): recovery rate Beginning with X, the vector of disease compartments. For the SIQR model, \\(X = \\begin{bmatrix} I\\\\ Q\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) Refer back to the definitions of the new infection vector \\(F(x)\\) and the transition vector \\(V(x)\\) in Chapter 5.2.1. 6.2.2 Defining the Disease Free Equilibrium Due to the closed system definition of the article, this SIQR Compartmental Model can only be solved at the DFE. This is due to the nature of a closed system in which the disease has already dissipated, thus, the Endemic Equilibrium cannot exist. However, modifications to create an open system with birth and death rates incorporated, an Endemic Equilibrium can then be solved for. The Disease Free Equilibrium exists when all infected compartments (I and Q), are set to 0. Thus, \\(I=0\\) and \\(Q=0\\). So: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\dot{S} &amp;= -\\alpha S I = 0\\\\ \\dot{I} &amp;= \\alpha S I - \\beta I = 0 \\\\ \\dot{Q} &amp;= \\beta I - \\gamma Q = 0 \\\\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\gamma Q = 0 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] At the DFE: \\(\\dot{S}\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) \\(\\dot{I}\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) \\(\\dot{Q}\\) is true when \\(I=0\\) and \\(Q=0\\) \\(\\dot{R}\\) is true when \\(Q=0\\) Since there are no infections: \\(I=Q=R=0\\) This means that for \\(N=S+I+Q+R\\), \\(N=S\\) due to our earlier statements So at the DFE for the \\((S,I,Q,R) = (S,0,0,0) = (N,0,0,0)\\) It is important to note that we normally use \\(\\beta\\) for the transmission parameter, while in this example it is \\(\\alpha\\). Additionally \\(\\beta\\) becomes the quarantine rate and \\(\\gamma\\) remains as the recovery rate. 6.2.3 Solving the SIQR Model 6.2.3.1 Defining F and V Matrices Recall: that for the SIQR model the disease compartments are I and Q: \\(\\dot{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{I}\\\\ \\dot{Q}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) In order to define the distinction between new infections and transferred compartments, we create 2 matrices: Transmission (F) and Transition (V) Transmission Matrix (F) In this Matrix, only compartments in which new infections are created \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ F(x) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{I}\\\\ \\dot{Q}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ F(x) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S I - \\beta I \\\\ \\beta I - \\gamma Q \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ F(x) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S I \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] Transition Matrix (V) In this Matrix, using \\(V = V^- + V^+\\), we can find the transfer of infected individuals in and out of infected compartments We can see this transfer as each of the values stated below leave/subtracted from a differential equation of a compartment and enter/added to the differential equation of the next compartment \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ V(X) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta I \\\\ -\\beta I + \\gamma Q \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Referring back to Chapter 5.2.1 once again for the equation for \\(\\dot{X} = F(x) - V(x)\\), we combine these matrices into: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S I \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta I \\\\ -\\beta I + \\gamma Q \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] For simplicity in later calculations: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ F(x) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S I \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ V(x) &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta I \\\\ -\\beta I + \\gamma Q \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\\\ V_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] 6.2.3.2 Taking the Jacobian Matrix of F and V Let the Jacobian of F(x) be F. \\[ \\boldsymbol{F} = J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] At DFE, \\(S = 1\\) This is found by our earlier definition of the DFE. At the DFE for \\((S,I,Q,R) = (S,0,0,0) = (N,0,0,0)\\) Since Population \\(&quot;N&quot;=1\\) and \\(S=N\\), then \\(S=1\\) So after subsituting \\(S=1\\): \\[ J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] Let the Jacobian of V(x) be V. \\[ \\boldsymbol{V} = J_V (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial E} &amp; \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial I} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\beta &amp; \\gamma \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] 6.2.3.3 Finding the Next Generation Matrix Refer to Chapter 5.2.3 where the NGM for the SEIR model is found. We will be using a similar structure once again. \\(NGM = \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1}\\) Thus: \\[ \\boldsymbol{F} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] For \\(\\boldsymbol{V}^{-1}\\), we use the same inverse matrix rule. \\[\\begin{align*} \\boldsymbol{V} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\beta &amp; \\gamma \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;= \\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;=\\frac{1}{\\beta \\gamma} \\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma &amp; 0 \\\\ \\beta &amp; \\beta \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\beta} &amp; 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] So \\(\\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1}\\) is: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha S &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\beta} &amp; 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} &amp; \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp;0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align*} \\] 6.2.3.4 Calculating \\(R_0\\) and Defining Stability As stated previously in (Chapter 5.2.3), \\(R_0\\) is the spectral radius of the Next Generation Matrix \\(\\ \\boldsymbol{F} \\boldsymbol{V}^{-1}\\) \\[ det \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} - \\lambda &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; - \\lambda \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = - \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} - \\lambda \\right) \\] Let \\(- \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} - \\lambda \\right) = 0\\) (\\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) respectively) So \\(\\lambda_1 = 0\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\\). \\(\\lambda_2\\) is the largest eigenvalue, so \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\\). Thus: If \\(R_0 &lt; 1\\) then the DFE is stable, and the disease dies out This means that \\(\\alpha S &lt; \\beta\\) If \\(R_0 &gt; 1\\) then the DFE is unstable, and an epidemic occurs This means that \\(\\alpha S &gt; \\beta\\) 6.2.4 Example with Parameter Values and Simulation Throughout this textbook, we have discussed how to solve and understand varying models on a theoretical level. However; we are also able to fit these models to data in with certain datasets. To do this, we will use a very commonly used example in the world of applied epidemiology, the 1978 Influenza Outbreak in a British Boarding School. The data contained total cases, quarantined defined as “Confined to Bed,” and Recovering defined as “Convalescent.” This was a closed system and contained detail reports to understand what occurred using our modern techniques and models. Doing so allows us to map the data into the variables of our models and understand the situation from which our data was recorded.[11] Parameter Values Our normal parameter values \\(\\beta, \\gamma, \\alpha\\) are derived using a MATLAB Optimization Toolbox By giving the solver the total population, N, which is 763 in this scenario, and setting the initial infected, I(0) equal to 1, the software can create predicted curves By minimizing the Standard Squared Error between the predicted curves and data points, the values of the parameters can be found Fitting the SIQR Model When fitting this model, there were two clear ways in which we could go about it Scenario 1: Combine both the I and Q compartments, so that the individuals identified as infected are active cases and not immediately quarantined and can still spread the disease, before becoming quarantined Scenario 2: Fit the model to only Q, so that the individuals identified as “Confined to Bed” are immediately quarantined and thus, are not able to continue spreading the disease This accounts for the time lag between being infected and quarantined, so that we can model the inital spike of disease in the population, I, occuring before they transfer to quarantine, Q, and predicting the transmission of disease during the period between the transfer Using the methodology of Scenario 2, we are able to find our parameters using the previously described processes: \\(N\\) = 763 \\(\\alpha\\) = .00297 \\(\\beta\\) = .79 \\(\\gamma\\) = .24 Using these parameters, and fitting the data, the model reveals, as expected, that the Infected compartment spikes before the quarantined compartment, accounting for spread of disease before transferring to the Quarantined compartment. Figure 6.2 is a time series plot showing these relationships. From these parameter values, we also obtain that \\(R_0 = 2.87 &gt; 1\\). Therefore, the endemic equilibrium is stable. Figure 6.2: Time series plot of SIQR model at endemic equilibrium, simulated with parameter values. 6.2.4.1 Complex Models Vs. Parsimony in Real World Situations As we have discussed, models may be too complex to fit the data. Key distinctions may be missing, which are vital to defining compartmental-specific data. In these scenarios, models are reduced to present a more general model while still being capable of great predictive power. In this specific scenario, the authors dive into attempting to use the SIQR model to use readily available data to define the perfect trends and relationships of COVID-19 in Missoula County, Montana, USA. The authors state how the available data for one of the applied cases of the model included Active and New cases. However, an issue arose since the data values are not able to define \\(\\gamma\\). This meant that individuals moved from Q to R were not defined, and thus, it was difficult to determine the transition number from individuals leaving the compartment. An individual might become recovered or quarantined but none of these outcomes are defined. Because the data could not effectively be fit to the SIQR model, the author’s decided to reduce the model to an SIR model. In this situation, the Q and R compartments would be combined, resolving the issue of the unclear distinction between the two compartments. While this does remove the dynamics between quarantine and recovery, and removing the role that quarantine plays in the context, reducing to an SIR model is still the most effective choice. The SIR model allows for a powerful model to be utilized due to fewer parameters, preventing over fitting. While the SIQR model would have given more precise results with distinctions between the Q and R compartments, using an SIR model still allows for a general trend to be established about the spread of the disease in this certain population and case. 6.3 The SVIR Model The model in this example is based on the parameters and variables defined in the articles by Ramponi et al. (2024) and Zhu X et al. (2024). [18] [27] A non-specific disease that considers vaccination of the population is modelled. The model includes a “V” compartment for vaccinated individuals, and takes into account vaccination rate, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine induced decline in the immune rate. Figure 6.3: The VSIR compartmental model. 6.3.1 Defining the Parameters and Model Formulation With \\(N(t)\\) representing the total population it can also be divided in to the four compartments: susceptible, vaccinated, infected and recovered. Therefore, \\(N(t) = V(t) + S(t) + I(t) + R(t)\\) The model assumes that after vaccination, people will develop immunity but after some time they will become susceptible again as the immunity wares off. Based on this, the following parameters can be defined: \\(\\Lambda\\) : susceptible individuals recruited by immigration/birth \\(\\beta\\) : effective contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals \\(d\\) : natural death rate \\(\\theta\\) : vaccine effectiveness rate \\(\\gamma\\) : vaccination rate of susceptible individuals \\(b\\) : cure rate of infected individuals \\(\\alpha\\) : disease induced mortality \\(\\delta\\) : loss rate of immunity The epidemic dynamical model is given by the following four models : \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{dV}{dt} &amp;= \\gamma S -(1- \\theta) \\beta VI - (\\gamma +d)V \\\\ \\frac{dS}{dt} &amp;= \\Lambda + \\delta V - \\beta SI - (\\gamma + d)S \\\\ \\frac{dI}{dt} &amp;= \\beta SI + (1- \\theta) \\beta VI - (d+ \\alpha + b)I \\\\ \\frac{dR}{dt} &amp;= bI - dR\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] 6.3.2 Defining the Disease Free Equilibrium 6.3.2.1 Solving for the Basic Reproduction Number From here the basic reproduction number, \\(R_0\\), can be solved for using the next generation matrix method. When \\(\\theta = \\gamma = \\delta =0\\), the system is then the SIR model essentially. Finding the regeneration and transfer matrix then gives: \\[ F_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, V_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} (d+ \\alpha + b) I \\\\ -bI + dR \\\\ - \\Lambda + \\beta SI +dS \\end{bmatrix} \\] The next step would be to differentiate \\(F_0\\) and \\(V_0\\) and calculate the value of \\(E_{00} = (S_{00},0,0) = (\\frac{\\Lambda}{d} , 0,0)\\) which is at the DFE of the SIR model. It can be found that \\[ F_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta S_{00} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}, V_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} (d + \\alpha + b) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ -b &amp; d &amp; 0 \\\\ \\beta S_0 &amp; 0 &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\] Since \\(R_0 = \\rho (F_0 V^{-1}_0)\\), \\[ R_0 = \\frac {\\beta S_{00}}{d+b+\\alpha } = \\frac{\\beta \\Lambda}{d(d+b+ \\alpha)} \\] Using this same process to solve for the SVIR. system’s disease free equlibrium, the derivatives can be set to 0, that is, \\(E_0 = (V_0, S_0, 0,0) = (\\frac{\\Lambda \\gamma} {d (\\delta + d +\\gamma)} , \\frac {\\Lambda (\\delta + d)} {d (\\delta + d +\\gamma)}, 0,0 )\\) Where \\(x = (I, R, V, S)^T\\), the regeneration matrix, \\(F\\) and the transfer matrix, \\(V\\) can be found to be : \\[ F = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI + (1- \\theta) \\beta VI \\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, V =\\begin{bmatrix} (d + \\alpha +b) I \\\\ -bI + dR\\\\ -\\gamma S + (1-\\theta) \\beta VI +(\\delta +d) V \\\\ - \\Lambda - \\delta V + \\beta SI + (\\gamma +d)S \\end{bmatrix} \\] 6.3.2.2 Computing the Basic Reproduction Number for the SVIR Model To compute the basic reproduction number using the next-generation method, we separate the system into: new infection terms, denoted by \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) all other transitions, denoted by \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) The system state is ordered as: \\[ x = (I, R, V, S)^T \\] From the SVIR model, only the infected class \\(I\\) receives new infections. Therefore, the new infection terms are: \\[ \\mathcal{F} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta SI + (1-\\theta)\\beta V I\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] All other terms in the system are collected into the transition matrix \\(\\mathcal{V}\\): \\[ \\mathcal{V} = \\begin{bmatrix} (d + \\alpha + b)I \\\\ -bI + dR\\\\ -\\gamma S + (1-\\theta)\\beta V I + (\\delta + d)V \\\\ -\\Lambda - \\delta V + \\beta S I + (\\gamma + d)S \\end{bmatrix} \\] 6.3.2.3 Linearization Around the Disease-Free Equilibrium The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) for the SVIR model is: \\[ E_0 = (V_0, S_0, 0, 0) \\] where: \\[ V_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda\\gamma}{d(\\delta + d + \\gamma)}, \\quad S_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda(\\delta + d)}{d(\\delta + d + \\gamma)} \\] We now compute the Jacobians \\(D\\mathcal{F}(E_0)\\) and \\(D\\mathcal{V}(E_0)\\). 6.3.2.4 Jacobian of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) Only the first component of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is non-zero: \\[ \\mathcal{F}_1 = \\beta SI + (1-\\theta)\\beta V I \\] Taking partial derivatives: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}_1}{\\partial I} = \\beta S + (1-\\theta)\\beta V, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}_1}{\\partial R} = 0 \\] Thus, the Jacobian evaluated at the DFE is: \\[ D\\mathcal{F}(E_0)= \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta S_0 + (1-\\theta)\\beta V_0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] We denote this upper-left block as \\(F\\). 6.3.2.5 Jacobian of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) The first two components of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) involve the infected subsystem: \\[ \\mathcal{V}_1 = (d + \\alpha + b)I, \\quad \\mathcal{V}_2 = -bI + dR \\] Taking partial derivatives: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}_1}{\\partial I} = d + \\alpha + b, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}_2}{\\partial I} = -b, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}_2}{\\partial R} = d \\] Thus, the upper-left block of \\(D\\mathcal{V}(E_0)\\) is: \\[ V = \\begin{bmatrix} d + \\alpha + b &amp; 0\\\\ -b &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\] Lower blocks exist for the vaccinated and susceptible compartments, but they do not affect the computation of the reproduction number and are dropped. 6.3.3 Solving the SVIR Model 6.3.3.1 Forming the Next-Generation Matrix The next-generation matrix is: \\[ FV^{-1} \\] First, compute the inverse of \\(V\\). For a matrix: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; 0\\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix} \\] the inverse is: \\[ \\frac{1}{ad} \\begin{bmatrix} d &amp; 0\\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{bmatrix} \\] Applying this formula gives: \\[ V^{-1} = \\frac{1}{d(d+\\alpha + b)} \\begin{bmatrix} d &amp; 0\\\\ b &amp; d+\\alpha + b \\end{bmatrix} \\] Now multiply: \\[ FV^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\beta\\left(S_0 + (1-\\theta)V_0\\right)}{d+\\alpha + b} &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] 6.3.3.2 Computing the Reproduction Number The basic reproduction number is the dominant eigenvalue (spectral radius) of \\(FV^{-1}\\): \\[ R_{\\text{vac}} = \\frac{\\beta\\left(S_0 + (1-\\theta)V_0\\right)}{d+\\alpha + b} \\] Substituting the formulas for \\(S_0\\) and \\(V_0\\): \\[ S_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda(\\delta + d)}{d(\\delta + d + \\gamma)}, \\quad V_0 = \\frac{\\Lambda\\gamma}{d(\\delta + d + \\gamma)} \\] 6.3.3.3 Interpretation \\(\\dfrac{\\beta}{d+\\alpha+b}\\) represents the expected number of infections produced by an infectious individual before leaving the infected class through recovery or death. \\(S_0 + (1-\\theta)V_0\\) is the effective number of individuals at risk, because: susceptible individuals contribute fully, vaccinated individuals contribute only by the fraction \\((1-\\theta)\\) that the vaccine fails. Thus: A higher vaccination rate \\(\\gamma\\), a more effective vaccine \\(\\theta\\), both reduce \\(R_{\\text{vac}}\\), helping to prevent the spread of infection. 6.3.4 Example with Parameter Values and Simulation The following parameter values were retrieved from the article by Zhu et al. (2024) [27]. \\(b= 0.0085\\) (cure rate of infected individuals ) \\(d = 0.005\\) (natural death rate) \\(\\theta = 0.6\\) (vaccine effectiveness rate) \\(\\beta = 0.29\\) (effective contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals) \\(\\delta = 0.005\\) (loss rate of immunity) \\(\\lambda = 10\\) (susceptible individuals recruited by immigration/birth) \\(\\alpha = 0.0099\\) (disease induced mortality) \\(\\gamma = 0.2\\) (vaccination rate of susceptible individuals) By plugging these parameter values into the previously solved equation for \\(R_{vac}\\), we obtain \\(R_{vac} = 2.4716*10^4 \\gg 1\\) . Thus, we conclude that the endemic equilibrium is stable and the disease will persist. Figure 6.4 represents a simulation based on these parameter values that displays the populations in each compartment of the VSIR model over the period of 1 year. Due to the set-up of the model, the time series plot does not follow the usual trends of compartmental model time series plots. In Figure 6.5, we focus on the initial 10 days of the VSIR simulation. From this, we can see that the compartments change very drastically within a single day (this looks like a vertical drop in the Vaccination compartment of Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Time series plot of VSIR model at endemic equilibrium, simulated with parameter values for 1 year time scale. Figure 6.5: Time series plot of VSIR model at endemic equilibrium, simulated with parameter values for 10 days time scale. 6.4 The SAIR Model SAIR model is a four compartment model that considers asymptomatic infected individuals (compartment “A”) as separate from the symptomatic individuals (compartment “I”). In this section we will use the NGM to solve an example of SAIR that models COVID-19. This example was modified from a paper by Ouyang et al. (2025) [17], and it should be noted that the model includes parameters for vital dynamics (birth, death) and vaccination. This example showcases how models can become increasingly complex to solve and interpret when more parameters are involved. Figure 6.6: The SAIR compartmental model. 6.4.1 Defining the Parameters SAIR Model Parameters: \\(p\\): proportion of population that shows symptoms (\\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\)) \\((1-p)\\): proportion of population that does not show symptoms \\(\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S\\): new infection \\(\\beta\\): transmission rate \\(\\alpha\\): relative infectivity of asymptomatic infected (A) to symptomatic infected (I) (\\(0 &lt; a &lt; 1\\)) \\(\\gamma\\): rate of the asymptomatic infected individuals’ self-healing (producing antibodies for resistance to diseases) \\(\\epsilon\\): rate of the asymptomatic infected individuals showing symptoms (if resistance to disease is poor) \\(\\frac{uI}{1+kI}\\): saturated treatment function represented by the Holling Type 2 Functional Response [19], which considers saturation of treatment rate when the numbers of infected are high. \\(u\\): cure rate of the infected individual \\(k\\): handling time \\(\\frac{u}{k}\\): maximal treatment capacity, due to limited medical resources or handling time \\(\\delta\\): immunization rate of susceptible population from vaccination (this model considers vaccination without including a fifth compartment) vital dynamics: \\(\\Lambda\\): recruitment rate of susceptible population (e.g. births, immigration) \\(\\mu\\): natural death rate per capita (all deaths unrelated to the disease) \\(\\theta\\): mortality rate of the disease (all deaths caused by the disease) We define the differential equations for the SAIR Model as follows: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= \\Lambda -\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S - (\\mu + \\delta) S \\\\ \\ \\dot{A} &amp;= (1-p)\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S-(\\gamma + \\epsilon + \\mu)A \\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= p\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S+\\epsilon A - \\frac{uI}{1+kI} - (\\mu + \\theta)I \\\\ \\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\delta S + \\frac{uI}{1+kI} + \\gamma A - \\mu R \\\\ \\ \\end{align*} \\] For the SAIR model, \\(\\dot{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{A} \\\\ \\dot{I}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\), where X is the matrix representing the infected compartments. 6.4.2 Defining the Disease Free Equilibrium (DFE) The Disease Free Equilibrium exists when all infected compartments (A and I), are set to 0. i.e. \\(A=0\\) and \\(I=0\\). (Definition 3.3). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{S} &amp;= \\Lambda -\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S - (\\mu + \\delta) S &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\ \\dot{A} &amp;= (1-p)\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S-(\\gamma + \\epsilon + \\mu)A &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\ \\dot{I} &amp;= p\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S+\\epsilon A - \\frac{uI}{1+kI} - (\\mu + \\theta)I &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\ \\dot{R} &amp;= \\delta S + \\frac{uI}{1+kI} + \\gamma A - \\mu R &amp;= 0 \\\\ \\ \\end{align*} \\] By setting all of the differential equations to 0, we obtain that initial \\(S\\) is \\(S = \\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu+\\delta}\\). Note that since we allow the population to vary by vital dynamics, we get \\(N \\neq 1\\). Therefore, at the DFE: \\((S, A, I, R) = (\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu+\\delta}, 0, 0, \\frac{\\delta\\Lambda}{\\mu(\\mu+\\delta)})\\) 6.4.3 Solving SAIR Model with NGM We begin by finding \\(R_0\\), starting with the X matrix. \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{A} \\\\ \\dot{I}\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\ \\dot{X} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} (1-p)\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S-(\\gamma + \\epsilon + \\mu)A \\\\ p\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S+\\epsilon A - \\frac{uI}{1+kI} - (\\mu + \\theta)I \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] So then, from X we obtain: \\(\\boldsymbol{F} = \\begin{bmatrix} (1-p)\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S \\\\ p\\beta(I+\\alpha A)S \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} F_1 \\\\ F_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{V} = \\begin{bmatrix} (\\gamma + \\epsilon + \\mu)A \\\\ -\\epsilon A + \\frac{uI}{1+kI} + (\\mu + \\theta)I \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\\\ V_2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\) Solving for the Jacobian matrices, we get: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\ \\boldsymbol{F} &amp;= J_F (x) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial A} &amp;

1\\) indicates continuous spread of the disease (EE is stable), and \\(R_0 &lt; 1\\) indicates that the disease will eventually die out (DFE is stable). 6.4.4 Example Parameters and Simulation The following parameter values were retrieved from the article by Ouyang et al. (2025) [17], and also considers some demographic data from the United States of America in 2020. \\(p = 0.0065\\) (proportion of symptomatic individuals) \\(\\beta = 0.05\\) (transmission rate) \\(\\alpha = 0.00025\\) (relative infectivity of asymptomatic individuals) \\(\\gamma = 0.12\\) (rate of asymptomatic self-healing) \\(\\epsilon = 0.25\\) (rate of asymptomatic individuals showing symptoms) \\(\\delta = 0.04\\) (immunization rate) saturated treatment function: \\(u = 0.25\\) (cure rate) \\(k = 20\\) (handling time) vital dynamics: \\(\\Lambda = 1\\) (recruitment rate) \\(\\mu = 0.014\\) (natural death rate) \\(theta = 0.01\\) (COVID-19 death rate) By plugging these parameter values into the previously solved equation for \\(R_0\\), we obtain \\(R_0 = 2.208 &gt; 1\\). Thus, we conclude that the endemic equilibrium is stable and the disease will persist. Figure 6.7 represents a simulation based on these parameter values that displays the populations in each compartment of the SAIR model over the period of 2 years.

In all of these models, we assume that every susceptible person in proximity to an infected individual has an equal chance of becoming infected as well; while this is a great assumption for models and convenient for the mathematical processes we execute, it does not accurately reflect real-world disease transmission dynamics. Because of the omission of these external factors that reflect realism, understanding Spatial Epidemiology allows us to understand the geographical/physical factors that contribute to the spread of disease, and narrow down the random susceptibility of being infected to understanding the source at play. 7.2 Metapopulations In past models, we have broken down models into 3 compartments: S, I, and R. In these models, one key omission is the distinction of populations. These compartments model the entire population, but there might be variations in disease transmission, and a lack or abundance of prevalence of a disease in a certain location. In order to accurately account for this, we are able to use metapopulations. In this way, these populations are able to split so that the disease in each of these sub-populations can be understood. This allows us to see that maybe a disease is prevalent and rapidly spreading in one city, but is only just being introduced in another city, demonstrating weak coupling and asynchrony. Alternatively, strong coupling can exist, and the spread of disease in these two cities might occur at the same time. Thus, there is synchronization between the two metapopulations (City 1 and City 2). Utilizing metapopulations allows us to see these differences within the entire population, rather than coupling every population together. Example 7.1 (Metapopulation Example 1) Headline: There is a breakout of COVID-19 in the United States of America during early 2020’s Without Metapopulations: There are 100 million cases of COVID-19 With Metapopulations (Dividing the Populations By Time Zone): Coastal Timezone States (EST and PST) account for 75% of COVID-19 Cases in the USA Takeaway: Indicates that the disease is spreading from foreigners who are travelling into major airports on the coast rather than spreading through domestic transmission. The disease is synchronous in coastal cities, as foreigners are abundant in these areas and are spreading the disease; inner-domestic cities, while still being infected, are asynchronous, as the infections are only starting to spread in these regions. Example 7.2 (Metapopulation Example 2) Headline: In January 2025, there was a breakout of Measles in the United States of America Without Metapopulations: There are 1,798 cases of Measles With Metapopulations: 87% of all cases occur in close-knit, unvaccinated communities in South/South Central States (Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico) Takeaway: The transmission of the disease between these specific unvaccinated communities is a synchronized metapopulation that acts together, while external vaccinated populations can combat this disease and prevent further spreading. These are basic examples, but they help illustrate how defining metapopulations allows for further in-depth analysis of the spread of a disease within a population rather than a single group, such as those defined in our models. [13] [25] 7.3 Diffusion and Travel In Epidemiology, the travel and transmission of disease are not random. There are many different ways in which a disease can travel, whether at airports from foreign contact, waterborne from an infected spout, between communities with specific characteristics, etc. Being able to understand the differences in how these diseases spread, we must understand the different types of diffusion that contribute to these distinctions. Expansion Diffusion A disease spreads outward from the initial source, but remains intensified at the origin as it continues to spread. This is the most common type of disease spreading, as it continues to spread from new infections as well as the source. Examples: H1N1 (Swine Flu), COVID-19, Common Cold Characteristics: Mass Outbreaks, Continuous Spread Relocation Diffusion A disease/infected population migrates from the initial source, becoming prevalent in a new location; the prevalence at the origin declines. This can occur because the host/source moves, and transmission begins in the new area and stops in the old area, without infecting areas in between Examples: 2010 Haiti Cholera Outbreak, STDs Characteristics: Discontinuous Spread, Migration Contagious Diffusion The chance of being infected is strictly based on the distance to an infected individual. The chance of catching an infection is inversely proportional to the distance from the infected. Examples: Varicella-Zoster, Ebola Characteristics: Based on Distance-Decay, Slow Spreading, Continuous Wave Hierarchical Diffusion A disease spreads from larger hubs to smaller hubs based on connectivity. A disease spreads from a large hub to another hub and slowly makes its way into smaller and smaller hubs, usually through long-distance travel. Examples: Early COVID-19, HIV, H1N1 Characteristics: Non-contagious spread (Spatial Separation), Transportation-based References: [7] [9] 7.4 Networks In this section, we will look at the other way in which diseases spread. First, we looked at metapopulations and diffusion, in which the transmission of disease was spread geographically. Now we look at Networks, which involve the transmission of disease through social factors and structure. In our models, we assume that everyone has the same amount of contact, or homogenous contact, for simplicity; however, in the real world, this is not accurate, and contact is heterogeneous. 7.4.1 Contact Heterogeneity Since contact is not consistent between all individuals, we must define the distinctions that can cause variations in the transmission of diseases. If we recall, in our models we use \\(R_0\\), the basic reproductive number. In our models, \\(R_0\\) is proportional to the average number of contacts, since homogeneity is assumed. However, with heterogeneity, a person with a high number of contacts is integral to this topic, since they not only have the highest chances of becoming infected but also of spreading the infection. Because of this existence, the average is irrelevant, and the variance is the most relevant measure of disease transmission. Example 7.3 (Contact Homogeneity vs. Contact Heterogeneity) A comparison of two cities. City 1: Everyone is in contact with 5 people Average Contact: 5 = \\(R_0\\) If a person becomes infected, the disease has a constant transmission rate = \\(R_0\\), the average contacts in this case. City 2: 99 people are in contact with 1 person. 1 person is in contact with 401 people. Average Contact: Also 5 However, if the 99 people become infected, the disease will spread too slowly and die out; if the 1 person becomes infected, then the disease is instantly spread to 401 people, leading to an epidemic. So, while the mean number of contacts in each town is the same, because 1 person has an egregious and abnormal amount of contacts, you must account for the variance and the existence of the one outlier. 7.4.2 Scale Free Networks As seen in the previous example with City 2, most people had a low contact rate, and few had abnormal contact rates. This distribution is called a Poisson Distribution, and this phenomenon is reflected in the real world, and is known as a scale-free network. The person with an abnormal contact rate is known as a Hub, and is the primary subject of the hub effect. As diseases spread within this type of population, they will eventually come into contact with a hub, which will then exponentially infect a large number of individuals instantly. It is observed that in scale-free networks, the epidemic may never die out without intervention, thus becoming endemic. [14] 7.5 Ring Vaccination As discussed before, with herd immunity, a population can become protected if enough of the population becomes vaccinated. However, this may sometimes be hard to achieve, especially when an outbreak suddenly occurs. To combat this case, a new concept, called Ring Vaccination, takes effect. By tracking an initial case, the network of individuals connected to the initial case can be found and vaccinated. Then, the contacts of those contacts can also be vaccinated. This is very effective as only the susceptible people in contact with the infected individual can be protected and thus prevent the transmission of the disease. This only works with slower transmitting diseases; as with the case of COVID-19, if a vaccination existed, Ring Vaccination may not be effective since the transmission of the disease occurred rapidly. In the modern day, the Ring of Vaccination is implemented slightly differently, since the goal is to prevent outbreaks before they happen rather than after. Even if not enough vaccinations are available to achieve herd immunity, by vaccinating rings, so networks of people, rather than random individuals, if a disease were to occur, then the spread can be contained and thus eradicated (at that instance). Thus, an outbreak cannot occur if enough rings are in place to contain the transmission. [1] [6] 7.6 Agent-Based Models We have only looked at Compartmental Models, in which we use different transmission rates and parameters to model the changes of a population as the population becomes infected, as well as the specifics on the spread of the disease. However, there are many other types of models, such as an Agent-Based Model. Instead of assuming homogeneity for a population, we can model each individual as an agent with specific characteristics. These can range from age, occupation, antibody protection levels, and even their day-to-day life. These agents can even be programmed to behave differently, such as if they become sick, they will lock themselves down. All of this is done to simulate reality by creating agents that can reflect the behaviors and choices of the average population. When simulated, aspects of these models can be altered to test different outcomes. For example, if an epidemic occurs within the Agent-Based Model, the researchers can test whether closing an airport or switching their water supply can affect the spread of disease. Similar to the discussion with Stochastic Models, these can reflect the randomness and variability of reality; however, while Agent-Based Models reflect stochasticity, the complexity involved with these models proves instead to be a limitation, as it can be difficult to understand the true origins, causes, and effects at play when the model is altered. Additionally, as stated with the complexity, these models are also very hard to create without intensive labor and data available. So while these models are able to simulate normal lives of people, the complexities may also prove futile in the goal of truly understanding and testing population and transmission dynamics.
