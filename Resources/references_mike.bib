Analytical properties of R-eff are rarely studied. We analytically examine how and under which conditions the conventional susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model (without infection age) serves as an approximation to the infection-age-structured SIR model. Special emphasis is given to the role of R-eff, which is an implicit parameter in the infection-age-structured SIR model and an explicit parameter in the approximation. The analytical findings are illustrated by a simulation study about an hypothetical intervention during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and by historical data from an influenza outbreak in Prussian army camps in the region of Arnsberg (Germany), 1918–1919.}, journal={Frontiers in Epidemiology}, publisher={Frontiers}, author={Brinks, Ralph and Hoyer, Annika}, year={2024}, month=dec, language={English} }

Further bounds and numerical illustrations are provided, broadly spanning situations where the size of the epidemic is short of infecting almost all those susceptible. The total size is moderately sensitive to changes in the population parameters that contribute to R 0, so that the fluctuating behaviour in ‘annual’ epidemics is not surprising.}, number={A}, journal={Journal of Applied Probability}, author={Daley, Daryl J. and Swift, Randall J.}, year={2011}, month=aug, pages={235–247}, language={en} }

However, it is important to correctly classify reported data and understand how this impacts estimation of model parameters. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an abundant amount of data that allow for thorough testing of disease modelling assumptions, as well as how we think about classical infectious disease modelling paradigms. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the appropriateness of model parameter estimates and prediction results in classical infectious disease compartmental modelling frameworks given available data types (infected, active, quarantined, and recovered cases) for situations where just one data type is available to fit the model. Our main focus is on how model prediction results are dependent on data being assigned to the right model compartment. METHODS: We first use simulated data to explore parameter reliability and prediction capability with three formulations of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) modelling framework. We then explore two applications with reported data to assess which data and models are sufficient for reliable model parameter estimation and prediction accuracy: a classical influenza outbreak in a boarding school in England and COVID-19 data from the fall of 2020 in Missoula County, Montana, USA. RESULTS: We demonstrated the magnitude of parameter estimation errors and subsequent prediction errors resulting from data misclassification to model compartments with simulated data. We showed that prediction accuracy in each formulation of the classical disease modelling framework was largely determined by correct data classification versus misclassification. Using a classical example of influenza epidemics in an England boarding school, we argue that the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model is more appropriate than the commonly employed SIR model given the data collected (number of active cases). Similarly, we show in the COVID-19 disease model example that reported active cases could be used inappropriately in the SIR modelling framework if treated as infected. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the role of misclassification of disease data and thus the importance of correctly classifying reported data to the proper compartment using both simulated and real data. For both a classical influenza data set and a COVID-19 case data set, we demonstrate the implications of using the “right” data in the “wrong” model. The importance of correctly classifying reported data will have downstream impacts on predictions of number of infections, as well as minimal vaccination requirements.}, number={1}, journal={Infectious Disease Modelling}, author={Kalachev, Leonid and Landguth, Erin L. and Graham, Jon}, year={2023}, month=mar, pages={72–83}, language={eng} }

The theoretical framework introduces essential definitions, finite-time stability (FTS) criteria, and novel fractional-order modeling insights. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results under various parameters, demonstrating the finite-time convergence to equilibrium states. Results highlight the flexibility of FO models in addressing delayed responses and prolonged effects, offering enhanced predictive accuracy over traditional integer-order approaches.

The overall burden of influenza is captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influenza-like illness network, which provides invaluable information about the current incidence. This information is used to provide decision support regarding prevention and response efforts. Despite the relatively rich surveillance data and the recurrent nature of seasonal influenza, forecasting the timing and intensity of seasonal influenza in the U.S. remains challenging because the form of the disease transmission process is uncertain, the disease dynamics are only partially observed, and the public health observations are noisy. Fitting a probabilistic state-space model motivated by a deterministic mathematical model [a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model] is a promising approach for forecasting seasonal influenza while simultaneously accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. A significant finding of this work is the importance of thoughtfully specifying the prior, as results critically depend on its specification. Our conditionally specified prior allows us to exploit known relationships between latent SIR initial conditions and parameters and functions of surveillance data. We demonstrate advantages of our approach relative to alternatives via a forecasting comparison using several forecast accuracy metrics.}, number={1}, journal={The Annals of Applied Statistics}, publisher={Institute of Mathematical Statistics}, author={Osthus, Dave and Hickmann, Kyle S. and Caragea, Petruţa C. and Higdon, Dave and Del Valle, Sara Y.}, year={2017}, pages={202–224} }

It derives moment conditions for the number of infected and active cases for single as well as multigroup epidemic models. These moment conditions are used to investigate the identification and estimation of the transmission rates. The paper then proposes a method that jointly estimates the transmission rate and the magnitude of under-reporting of infected cases. Empirical evidence on six European countries matches the simulated outcomes once the under-reporting of infected cases is addressed. It is estimated that the number of actual cases could be between 4 to 10 times higher than the reported numbers in October 2020 and declined to 2 to 3 times in April 2021. The calibrated models are used in the counterfactual analyses of the impact of social distancing and vaccination on the epidemic evolution and the timing of early interventions in the United Kingdom and Germany.}, number={6}, journal={Journal of Applied Econometrics}, author={Pesaran, M.

The model is formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations and is further extended by incorporating fractional-order derivatives in the Caputo sense to capture memory effects in disease transmission. A thorough investigation of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points is conducted, encompassing both local and global stability at the disease-free state. The basic reproduction number,, is derived, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key parameters influencing the transmission dynamics. To ensure mathematical rigor, the existence and uniqueness of the model’s solutions are also examined. For numerical approximation, the two-step Lagrange polynomial method is applied, enabling simulation of the model under various fractional orders and parameter settings. The results demonstrate that the fractional-order approach offers deeper insights into the dynamics of dengue transmission, highlighting the importance of memory effects. These findings provide valuable guidance for medical professionals, policymakers, and public health authorities in designing more effective control strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, publisher={Nature Research}, author={Verma, Lalchand and Meher, Ramakanta and Nikan, Omid and Al-Saedi, Akeel A.}, year={2025}, language={English} }

Certain pathogens, however, including the emerging West Nile virus (WN) in North America, exhibit a complex seasonal ecology that is not readily analysed with standard epidemiological methods. We develop a single-season susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model of WN cross-infection between birds and mosquitoes, incorporating specific features unique to WN ecology. We obtain the disease reproduction number, R 0, and show that mosquito control decreases, but bird control increases, the chance of an outbreak. We provide a simple new analytical and graphical method for determining, from standard public health indicators, necessary mosquito control levels. We extend this method to a seasonally variable mosquito population and outline a multi-year model framework.
