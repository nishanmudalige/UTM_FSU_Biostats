# UTM_FSU_Biostats
E-book created with bookdown for teaching biostats 

- **Introduction**: history of (mathematical) epidemiology, role of models in public health, introduction to compartmental modelling thinking (benefits of parsimonious models).
- **Modelling disease dynamics with ODEs**: compartmental diagrams, ODE setup, solving basic models, numerical simulation basics.
- **Epidiological metrics and outcomes**: R_0, effective reproduction number, herd immunity, endemic equilibria
- **Analytical tools**: stability analysis, Lyapunov functions, next generation matrix
- **Futher compartments**: latent periods (SEIR), asymptomatic (SAIR), waning immunity (SIRS)
- **Interventions and control**: vaccination (SVIR), quarantine, treatment strategies
- **Demography**: birth/death rates, age-structured models
- **Spatial epidemiology**: metapopulations, difussion and travel, networks, contact heterogeneity, ring vaccination
