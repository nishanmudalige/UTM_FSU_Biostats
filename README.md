## Things to do

- Write definitions in the definition environment
- Rewrite Chapter 2: Introduction to Mathematical modelling
  - Move Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking to chapter 2 (place at appropriate point)
  - Introduce compartmental modelling by describing flow of units from copartments and sign of parameters, interaction etc.
- Chapter 3
  - Describe models and parameters in words so the reader will get a better intuition about whh the models make sense
  - Describe parameters
  - Can elaborate on how they are obtained from real world data (eg determining # of new infected by a confirmed case)
  - Add figures to chapter 3

## High level topics

- **Introduction**: history of (mathematical) epidemiology, role of models in public health, introduction to compartmental modelling thinking (benefits of parsimonious models).
- **Modelling disease dynamics with ODEs**: compartmental diagrams, ODE setup, solving basic models, numerical simulation basics.
- **Epidiological metrics and outcomes**: R_0, effective reproduction number, herd immunity, endemic equilibria
- **Analytical tools**: stability analysis, Lyapunov functions, next generation matrix
- **Futher compartments**: latent periods (SEIR), asymptomatic (SAIR), waning immunity (SIRS)
- **Interventions and control**: vaccination (SVIR), quarantine, treatment strategies
- **Demography**: birth/death rates, age-structured models
- **Spatial epidemiology**: metapopulations, difussion and travel, networks, contact heterogeneity, ring vaccination
