## Things to do
- Chapter 3
  - Add introduction
- Add more detail to subsection on SI Model (3.2)
- Format math statements in Chapter 3, 4
- Add introduction to Chapter 4
- Organize Chapter 4 into subsections

---
- Write definitions in the definition environment
- Rewrite Chapter 2: Introduction to Mathematical modelling
  - Move Introduction to Compartmental Modelling Thinking to chapter 2 (place at appropriate point)
  - Introduce compartmental modelling by describing flow of units from copartments and sign of parameters, interaction etc.
- Chapter 3
  - Describe models and parameters in words so the reader will get a better intuition about whh the models make sense
  - Describe parameters
  - Can elaborate on how they are obtained from real world data (eg determining # of new infected by a confirmed case)
  - Add figures to chapter 3

## High level topics

- **Introduction**: history of (mathematical) epidemiology, role of models in public health, introduction to compartmental modelling thinking (benefits of parsimonious models).
- **Epidemiological metrics and outcomes**: basic reproduction number (R_0), effective reproduction number (R_e), herd immunity, disease-free equilibria, endemic equilibria.
- **Modelling disease dynamics with ODEs**: compartmental diagrams, ODE setup, solving the SIS model, analyzing the SIR model, numerical simulation basics, plotting time series and phase diagrams.
- **Analytical tools**: a deeper dive on the analytical tools required (a crash course on dynamical systems), stability analysis, Lyapunov functions, next generation matrix.
- **Futher compartments**: latent periods (SEIR), asymptomatic (SAIR), waning immunity (SIRS).
- **Interventions and control**: vaccination (SVIR), quarantine, treatment strategies.
- **Demography**: birth/death rates, age-structured models.
- **Spatial epidemiology**: metapopulations, difussion and travel, networks, contact heterogeneity, ring vaccination, agent-based models.
