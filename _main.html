<p>This e-book provides an introduction to mathematical modeling in epidemiology, focusing on how to develop and analyze models, and how they inform public health decisions. We will learn about compartmental and agent-based models and their extensions that incorporate heterogeneities (age, space, behaviour). We will also explore disease control strategies. Simulation-based demonstrations and coding exercises will help connect theory to real-world insights.</p>
<p>Readers should have an understanding of Calculus 1 and 2, ODEs, Intro Stats/Probability, and Programming experience. A background in Linear Algebra is also recommended.</p>

<p>For all of human history, diseases have spread through groups of people. An epidemic is a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease at a particular time. An endemic disease, on the other hand, is one that is always present in certain populations. One of the earliest and deadliest epidemics known is the Black Death, also known as the bubonic plague, which started in Asia in 1346 and spread throughout Europe. Another widely known epidemic is the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-19 which caused more than 50 million deaths. Malaria and typhus are examples of endemic diseases. Most recently, COVID-19 caused a worldwide lockdown from 2020-2021, infecting 779 million and killing 7 million. The purpose of epidemiology is to understand the causes of a disease, predict its course, and develop ways of controlling its spread.</p>
<p>The first model in mathematical epidemiology was the work of Daniel Bernoulli on the inoculation of smallpox. Bernoulli calculated the increase in life expectancy if smallpox were removed as a cause of death. The beginnings of compartmental modelling started through the work of public health physicians. In 1906, W.H. Hamer proposed that the spread of infection should be observed by looking at individuals in compartments: susceptible and infective. Dr. Ronald Ross, who worked on malaria, was the first to introduce the concept of the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>), which quantifies the number of secondary infections caused by one case in a susceptible population.The framework was then expanded and formalized by Kermack and McKendrick in the late 1920s and early 1930s, laying the foundation for modern epidemic modeling.</p>

<p>Due to ethical concerns, it is difficult to design controlled experiments in epidemiology. In addition, epidemiologists may encounter incomplete and inaccurate data from measurement error, which can hinder parameter estimation and model fitting. (Smeden et al.; Brauer)</p>
<p>This is why mathematical modelling in epidemiology plays a major role in our understanding of mechanisms of disease spread. This understanding can suggest strategies for public health and health care responses regarding diseases and epidemics (Brauer; Silal et al.; Tolles &amp; Luong). Models can also identify variables that data may not show. For instance, some models can identify threshold behaviors of epidemics—an indicator of when a disease will become an epidemic, or dies out (Brauer). These indicators are based on (R<sub>0</sub>) in which, if the variable is above, below, or equal to 1, an epedemic may occur, die out or become endemic, respectively. This information could then be used to determine vaccination plans within a population as well as individually (Brauer). Being able to understand the future spread of disease will give insurmountable advantages in developing a plan of action to combat new infections; additionally, the development of herd immunity can safeguard an entire population through communal protection.</p>
<p>Compartmental models used today (originating from the Kermack-McKendrick model) can show disease transmission while observing time and infection number in relation to an epidemic (Tolles &amp; Luong). These models help understand diseases by dividing a population into compartments, such as the SIR model. These models utilize diverse mathematical equations and relationships to understand the flow and movementts between these models, defining these connections help predict the spread of disease regarding an outbreak. Compartmental models differ with diseases, and their development often relies on various policies. These models must undergo rigorous sensitivity testing to determine ideal parameters that impact model outcomes (Silal et al.).</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 of this book, we will be exploring the models that are used in modern epidemiology, such as the SIR model.</p>

<p>The two major types of mathematical models used in epidemiology are deterministic models and stochastic models.</p>
<p><strong>Deterministic models</strong> do not consider stochasticity (randomness), and predict results from known data (e.g. epidemic history; rules of models). These models are useful in large populations to observe epidemics in terms of the population and can help determine the fraction of individuals infected in an epidemic, as well as advise on disease control methods (Dadlani et al). Deterministic models can be written in terms of differential equations in continuous time, or difference equations in discrete time. A common approach for continuous time deterministic models is Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These deterministic compartmental models will be introduced in Chapter 2, while Chapter 3 will discuss solving simple models and their behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Stochastic models</strong> account for stochasticity (randomness) and are able to capture variability in demographics and environment. These models are useful with small populations and can be used in determining how long a disease lasts, the probability of an epidemic, and distribution of behaviours (Dadlani et al.). Some types of stochastic models include Discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Although stochastic models may better reflect reality, they are more labour-intensive to set-up than deterministic models and can also be more difficult to analyze.</p>

<p>As varying global health concerns persist, it is imperative to understand the complexities within the spread of infectious diseases. The most prevalent of which is compartmental modelling. This is a model that follows the change in proportions of populations in different compartments over time. The most common form of this type of model is the SIR model, organized in three separate compartments: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. Additional forms of this model may incorporate more compartments to attempt to enhance predictability. As computational power and modelling in the field of epidemiology have evolved, the growing use of parsimonious models, such as the SIR model, has become more relevant. These models utilize simpler processes by using accessible key data across broader conditions to produce a sufficiently predictive and generalizable model.</p>
<div id="approach-to-compartmental-modelling" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Approach to Compartmental Modelling<a href="#approach-to-compartmental-modelling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Referring back, compartmental modelling is the framework for prediction in epidemiology. The fundamental thinking behind the most common compartmental model, the SIR model, is that at any given point, a person will fall into either the Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered compartments, under the model’s assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Susceptible</strong>: Those at risk of the disease, but not yet infected</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infected</strong>: Those currently infected, and can actively spread the disease to those who are Susceptible</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recovered</strong>: Individuals who have recovered and developed immunity, or died from the disease</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Diving deeper, the relationship between each of these compartments is defined by differential equations, specifically ODEs and dynamical systems. These differential equations depict the movement between S and I, as well as I and R. The differential equations will show the flow of susceptible individuals to the infected compartment as the disease is transmitted at the transmission rate (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) as well as the flow of infected individuals either back to the susceptible compartment or to the recovered compartment at the recovery rate(<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>).</p>
<p>Other forms of the SIR model exist, in which compartments are added to depict realistic features of disease transmission. Each of these models utilizes an additional compartment that accounts for specific epidemiological situations, described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEIR</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Exposed</em> - Represents individuals who are infected but not yet infectious</li>
<li>Accounts for the latency period, in which individuals may be infected, yet are not able to transmit the disease</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SAIR</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Asymptomatic</em> - Represents individuals who are infected but do not express symptoms</li>
<li>Accounts for hidden transmission by individuals without symptoms</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SIRS</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Susceptible</em> - An additional “S” compartment at the end represents those who have recovered but lose immunity and become susceptible again</li>
<li>Accounts for the misassumption that those who recover retain lifelong immunity</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>SVIR</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Vaccinated</em> - Represents individuals who have received immunity to a varying extent from vaccinations</li>
<li>Accounts for how vaccinations reduce the population of susceptible individuals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>These variations of the SIR model will be discussed at length in Chapter 5 and 6.1.</p>

<p>As seen, SIR models and other forms can provide great predictive power. Recently, parsimonious models have become of interest in epidemiological modelling. These models are based on the premise that the simplest answer is the best. Allude to earlier in this section where parsimonious models are defined. These are able to use significantly less data and parameters in order to produce a generalized and understandable model. In a real-world setting, these models have been effectively utilized to predict disease outbreaks. Not only are these models more accurate than those with more complexity, but they can also be applied to a multitude of situations; additionally, with the presence of noisy data, these models can also avoid over fitting.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Limitations of Compartmental Models<a href="#limitations-of-compartmental-models" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>While these models are effective at predicting and understanding the spread of disease, there are issues with both their simplicity and complexity. These models must use a vast amount of assumptions in order to be feasibly produced, which comes at the cost of precision and realism. Some of these assumptions include the interactions between humans, fixed parameters, and assumed immunity. In the real world, these assumptions are not constant or realistic, resulting in a model that may not accurately depict the spread of disease. As a result, additional compartments have been added, such as in SEIR, SAIR, SIRS, and SVIR models discussed earlier. However, the addition of more compartments creates further intricacies. The fundamental models discussed involve three to four compartments; other examples of models may contain a greater number of compartments. While this may improve the precision of the model, as discussed prior, real-world data is noisy. This may lead to over fitting the data, resulting in a lack of generalization and potentially reduced predictive ability.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Parameters</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> : Proportion of population that is infected.</p>
<p><strong>N</strong> : Total Population</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Differentials (<span class="math inline">\(\frac {dS}{dt}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac {dI}{dt}\)</span>): Net Flow of individuals in and out of specific compartments</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma I\)</span>: Recovery Rate of Infectious Individuals</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>: Recovery Rate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that each term of the equation is defined, we can start to understand the interactions occurring. First we will dive into the meaning of the signage of each term:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Positive (+): Represents Inflow; Adding individuals to a compartment</p></li>
<li><p>Negative (-): Represents Outlfow; Removing individuals from a compartment</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Compartmental models are designed specifically such that the people within move from one compartment to another. This movement is called flow. Below are equations representing the net flow of individuals into and out of Susceptible and Infectious compartments, respectively. This flow is represented by the differential in both equations.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac {dS}{dt} = -\beta SI + \gamma I
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac {dI}{dt} = +\beta SI - \gamma I
\]</span></p>
<p>The signs in each equation indicate the direction of flow between compartments. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(-\beta SI\)</span> represents the loss of susceptible individuals as they become infected, while <span class="math inline">\(+\beta SI\)</span> represents the corresponding gain in the infectious group. The same relationship applies to <span class="math inline">\(\gamma I\)</span>, which describes the recovery process in reverse.</p>
<p>Understanding the parameters and signage then, one can understand the equations above. <span class="math inline">\(\frac {dS}{dt}\)</span> calculates the net flow of the susceptible group by subtracting the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by adding the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of the population entering the susceptible compartment). <span class="math inline">\(\frac {dI}{dt}\)</span> calculates the net flow of the infected group by adding the total rate of new infections in a population (the proportion of the population entering the infected compartment) and by subtracting the recovery rate of infectious individuals (the proportion of people entering the susceptible compartment). These simple SI equations form the foundation for more complex models, such as SIR or SEIR, which introduce additional compartments to capture recovery, immunity, or incubation dynamics.</p>

<p>In the SIS model, it is assumed that an individual is either susceptible or infected and this means once an individual has recovered from the infection they return to the susceptible group. In this work through, it is assumed that the population stays roughly constant.</p>

\]</span></p>
<p>Reduce the system of 2 equations to just 1 by plugging in (1-S) for I: <span class="math display">\[
\frac {dS} {dt}= -\beta S(1-S) + \gamma (1-S) = (\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)
\]</span></p>
<p>By taking an integral of both sides, <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> can be determined:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\int \frac {1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int dt
\]</span></p>
<p>Partial Fractions can be used to solve this integral:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac {A}{\gamma - \beta S} + \frac {B}{1-S}= \frac {A(1-S)+B( \gamma - \beta S)}{( \gamma - \beta S)(1-S)}
\]</span></p>
<p>So then: $$ A(1-S)+B( - S) = 1</p>
<p>$$ And one can assume:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A + \beta \gamma = 1
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A + B \beta =0
\]</span></p>
<p>Through partial fractions it will be found that: <span class="math display">\[
A = \frac {1}{\beta - \gamma }
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
B = \frac {1}{\gamma - \beta}
\]</span></p>
<p>Plugging in the new A and B: <span class="math display">\[
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int \frac{\beta}{\beta - \gamma}\left(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}\right) + \frac{1}{\gamma - \beta}\left(\frac {1}{1-S}\right)dS
\]</span></p>
<p>Solving the integral on both sides results in:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\int \frac{1}{(\gamma - \beta S)(1-S)} dS = \int \frac{\beta}{\beta - \gamma}\left(\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta S}\right) + \frac{1}{\gamma - \beta}\left(\frac {1}{1-S}\right)dS
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac {1}{\gamma - \beta} \ln \left| \frac{\gamma - \beta S}{1-S} \right| = t+C
\]</span></p>
<p>Solving for S(t) finds:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S(t)= \frac {\gamma - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta )t}}{\beta - Ce^{(\gamma - \beta)t}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then solving for the constant: <span class="math display">\[
S(0) = \frac {\gamma - C}{\beta -C}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_0(\beta - C) = \gamma -C

<p><span class="math display">\[
S_0 \beta - \gamma = C(S_0 -1)

<h2 class="hasAnchor"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Solving the SIR Model<a href="#solving-the-sir-model" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Building what we have learnt previously from solving the SI model, we will now attempt to solve the SIR model.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Compartmental%20Diagrams/SIR.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The SIR model includes a new compartment, <strong>“R”</strong>, which represents recovery from infection; or alternatively, those removed from infection status. This removal can occur as a result of immunization from infection, immunity from recovering from the disease, isolation from the population, or death. Note that the latter demographic effects (birth/death) are not observed in our example, and different models can exist for those cases.</p>
<p>We define a new <strong>system of differential equations</strong> for the SIR model as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + \alpha R\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI - \gamma I\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I - \alpha R\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Defining the parameters:</strong> As before, the differentials represent the net flow of individuals in and out of compartments, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> represents infection rate (S to I). <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> represents recovery rate of the infected, but now individuals moving out of compartment “I” (infected) move into compartment “R” (recovered/removed). <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a new term in the equations that represents the re-susceptible rate where recovered individuals lose immunity and become susceptible again (R to S).</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(S,I,R \in [0,1]\)</span>. If the population is represented by <span class="math inline">\(N = S + I + R\)</span>, we can let <span class="math inline">\(N = 1\)</span> and get <span class="math inline">\(S + I + R = 1\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(R = 1 - S - I\)</span>.</p>
<p>Plugging into the system of equations we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta SI + 2(1 - S - I)
\]</span></p>
<p>However, unlike the SI model, the SIR model’s system of equations has no closed form solution. Instead, we can find the equilibrium for this system. This system is considered to be a <strong>dynamical system</strong>, and our analysis will be <strong>qualitative</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> the rate of individuals entering a compartment is equal to the rate of individuals leaving a compartment.</p>
<p>Thus, we can set each equation in our system of equations to 0.</p>
<p><strong>The new system of equations at equilibria:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0 = -\beta SI + \alpha R\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0 = \beta SI - \gamma I \Rightarrow 0 = (\beta S - \gamma) I\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0 = -\gamma I + \alpha R\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two types of equilibrium in epidemiology:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE):</strong> there are no infected in the population, so I* = 0 in our SIR model</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Endemic Equilibrium (EE):</strong> infected persist indefinitely, so I* &gt; 0 in our SIR model (notation: asterix indicates equilibrium solution)</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>First we solve for DFE.</strong> From equation 2 we get: <span class="math inline">\(I = 0\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(S=\frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span></p>
<p>Then plugging in <span class="math inline">\(I = 0\)</span> into the system of equations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0 = \alpha R\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0 = -\alpha R\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> from these 2 equations, we get <span class="math inline">\(R^* = 0\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(R = 1 - S - I\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R^* = 0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(I = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S^* = 1\)</span> (note: another way to write <span class="math inline">\(S^*\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\overline S\)</span>). We use the asterisk or bar to indicate equilibrium notation.</p>
<p>Therefore, at Equilibrium:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(S^*, I^*) = (1, 0)
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, at DFE, the entire population is susceptible to infection and no EE exists because the infectious population returns to zero once the endemic is over.</p>
<p><strong>Now, we solve for EE</strong>. Plugging <span class="math inline">\(S = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}\)</span> into the system of equations:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(0 = -\gamma I + \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(0 = \gamma I - \alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta} - I)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta}) = I (\gamma + \alpha)\)</span></p>
<p>Solving for I we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I^* =  \frac{\alpha (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\beta})}{\gamma + \alpha}
\]</span></p>
<p>Endemic equilibrium (EE) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(S^*, I^*) = \left( \frac{\gamma}{\beta}, \frac{\alpha (1- \gamma/\beta)}{\gamma + \alpha} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>EE requires a continuous supply of susceptible (“susceptible replacement”), for instance, by birth, or reduced immunity to the disease. Otherwise, I will approach 0 after the endemic.</p>
<p>Also, since <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &lt; \beta\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} &gt; 1\)</span>. The <strong>basic reproduction number (</strong><span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>) is a threshold quantity that indicates the occurrence of an epidemic. <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> can also be thought of as the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals (e.g. at initial time <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span>). Note that individual variation is excluded in the definition.</p>
<p>Specific values of <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> can be used to analyze the stability of equilibrium. This will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 4, but more generally for now:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R_0 &lt; 1\)</span>: DFE is stable, the infection dies out (i.e. when infected, an individual infects less than one person on average, then the disease dies out)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R_0 &gt; 1\)</span>: EE is stable, there is an epidemic (i.e. when infected, an individual infects more than one person on average, then the disease spreads)</p></li>
